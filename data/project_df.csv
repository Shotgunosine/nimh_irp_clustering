Current data suggests links between autism and defects in synaptic plasticity as seen in fragile X syndrome (FXS). Synaptic plasticity requires the exquisite temporal and spatial regulation of protein synthesis to ensure efficacious synaptic remodeling. Products of mutated genes in syndromic forms of autism point to a relationship between disrupted synaptic function and dysregulated protein metabolism. Our research on FXS in both rodent models and human subjects addresses our central hypothesis that dysregulated protein metabolism in the nervous system can lead to the development of autism in human subjects. FXS is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability in males with an estimated frequency of 1/4000. FXS is also the most common known cause of autism. Expansion of a CGG repeat sequence in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) on the X chromosome is the usual cause of FXS. Normally the CGG repeat sequence has 4-54 repeats. Individuals with repeat lengths of 55-200 have the fragile X premutation and are carriers of FXS. In this range the repeat is unstable and tends to expand in succeeding generations. When the sequence length expands to greater than 200 repeats, FMR1 is silenced, and its protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), is absent resulting in FXS. Besides moderate to severe intellectual disability, FXS is characterized by enlarged testicles, elongated face, immature-appearing dendritic spines, hyperactivity, anxiety, increased sensory sensitivity, autistic behavior, and seizures. The basis of our current work is our finding in a knockout (Fmr1 KO) mouse model of FXS that regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) are increased, particularly in hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus (Qin M et al. J Neurosci 25:5087, 2005). This finding is consistent with the proposed role of FMRP as a suppressor of translation and our hypothesis that a dysregulation of brain protein metabolism is a core phenotype in FXS. We have developed a quantitative autoradiographic method for measurement of rCPS in vivo, and we have adapted the method for use with positron emission tomography (PET) so that measurements can now also be made in human subjects. Our ability to measure rCPS in man may endow us with a marker of the disease and a means to measure the efficacy of proposed treatments in patients. Measurement of rCPS may provide a tool in the field: a means of assessing disease progress and potential treatment efficacy that is objective and quantitative. Based on results of our studies in the Fmr1 KO mouse, we proposed that changes in rCPS are a core phenotype of FXS and that in human subjects we would find an increased rCPS in selective regions of the brain. Most subjects with FXS are unable to undergo the PET study procedures awake, so we have used sedation to help them to remain motionless during PET studies. In our initial study we used propofol for sedation. In control subjects, propofol sedation had no effect on rCPS, but in patients with FXS studied under propofol-sedation we found statistically significant reductions in rCPS compared with sedated controls. A subsequent study in the Fmr1 KO mouse model indicated that propofol had very little effect on rCPS in wild type (WT) animals, but in Fmr1 KO mice propofol decreased rCPS significantly throughout the brain (Qin et al., J. Cerebr Blood Flow & Metab, 2013). We continue to address the question of rCPS in human subjects with FXS by studying subjects with a different sedative and, in a few subjects, studying them awake with a modified protocol. In accord with our hypothesis that a dysregulation of protein synthesis is a core phenotype in FXS, we continue to look for potential treatments that will alter the behavioral and rCPS phenotypes in the Fmr1 KO mouse model.

","Dysregulation of Protein Synthesis in Fragile X Syndrome and Other Developmental Disorders


","Section on Neuro-adaptation and Protein Metabolism, NIMH","
This work on human subjects was conducted under the protocol 06-M-0214, NCT00362843.During the 2018 funding period, we addressed the following: 1) rCPS measured with the L-1-C-11leucine PET method in participants with FXS and healthy volunteers studied either under dexmedetomidine sedation or in the awake state, 2) Effects of treatment with an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE-4D) on behavior and rCPS in Fmr1 KO mice, 3) rCPS in Tsc2+/- mice, 4) Effects of rapamycin treatment on Fmr1 KO mice, 5) Sleep abnormalities in Fmr1 KO and Tsc2+/- mice.1) Measurement of rCPS in human subjects with fragile X syndrome.  We used the L-1-C-11leucine PET method to measure rCPS.  As most fragile X participants were not able to undergo the PET study awake, we used dexmedetomidine for sedation during the imaging studies.  We first studied the effects of dexmedetomidine sedation on rCPS in ten healthy controls, and we found no significant effects.  Next, we studied nine fragile X participants under sedation and compared results with sedated healthy controls.  Mean rates of protein synthesis were similar in both groups.  Our concern was that sedatives could have a differential effect in FXS subjects, so we focused our efforts on trying to study these subjects without the use of sedatives. We modified our PET protocol to enable some fragile X participants to undergo the study awake.  We compared rates of cerebral protein synthesis in six fragile X participants in the awake state with results in ten healthy controls studied with the same procedure.  Contrary to our hypothesis, results indicate that rates of cerebral protein synthesis in the awake fragile X participants are decreased throughout the brain by 15-33% compared to healthy controls.  Our results indicate that the absence of fragile X mental retardation protein may trigger an imbalance of pathways involved in the regulation of translation resulting in significantly decreased rates of protein synthesis. A manuscript reporting these results is in preparation.2) Treatment of Fmr1 KO mice with an inhibitor of PDE-4D. Work from Berry-Kravis (Rush College of Medicine) indicates that cAMP is reduced in peripheral cells from patients with FXS and that in neuroblastoma cells cAMP production is regulated by FMRP. Moreover, work from the laboratory of T. Jongens (Univ. Penn.) shows that inhibition of PDE-4 ameliorates memory deficits in the dfmr1 fly and restores mGluR-dependent LTD to WT levels in the Fmr1 KO mouse. In collaboration with Tetra Discovery Partners, we are testing the efficacy of a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of PDE-4D (BPN-14770). We chronically treated Fmr1 KO mice with the PDE-4D NAM and measured its effects on behavior and rCPS. We are currently analyzing results of these studies.3) Effects of rapamycin treatment on Fmr1 KO mice. The mammalian target of rapamycin pathway (mTORC1) is reported to be upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and is thought to be important for the pathogenesis of this disorder.  We treated Fmr1 KO mice chronically with an mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, to determine if rapamycin treatment could reverse behavioral phenotypes.  We found that pS6 was upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and normalized by rapamycin treatment, but, except for an anxiogenic effect, rapamycin did not reverse any of the behavioral phenotypes examined.  Moreover, rapamycin treatment had an adverse effect on sleep and social behavior in both control and Fmr1 KO mice.  These results suggest that targeting the mTOR pathway in FXS is not a good treatment strategy and that other pathways should be considered. The results of these studies were published this year.4) rCPS in Tsc2+/- mice. Another syndromic form of autism under study in the SNPM is tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is an autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder manifested by a high incidence of seizures, intellectual disability, and autism. TSC is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, which encode for proteins that form a complex and interact with a small GTP-binding protein, RHEB, to inhibit mTORC1. mTORC1 is a central regulator of ribosomal biogenesis and translation initiation, and loss of TSC1/2 function results in increased activity of mTORC1.  We measured the effects of Tsc2 haploinsufficiency (Tsc2+/-) in three month old male mice on rCPS by means of the in vivo L-1-14Cleucine method.  This quantitative autoradiographic method includes an estimate of the integrated specific activity of the tracer amino acid in brain tissue.  The estimate accounts for recycling of unlabeled amino acids from tissue protein breakdown by means of a factor () that was determined in control and Tsc2+/- mice.  The value of  was higher in Tsc2+/- mice, indicating that a greater fraction of leucine in the tissue precursor pool for protein synthesis is derived from the plasma compared to controls, consistent with reduced rates of protein degradation.  We determined rCPS in freely-moving, awake male Tsc2+/- and control mice, and we used the genotype-specific values of  in the calculation of rCPS.  Unexpectedly, we found that rCPS were significantly decreased in 16 of the 17 brain regions analyzed in Tsc2+/- mice compared to controls.  Our results indicate a complex role of mTORC1 in the regulation of cerebral protein synthesis that has not been previously recognized.  The results of these studies were published this year.5) Sleep and neurodevelopmental disorders. Sleep abnormalities are one of the most prevalent concurrent disorders in patients diagnosed with neurodevelopmental syndromes. In these patients, the severity of behavioral abnormalities and the severity of sleep abnormalities are correlated. Given the importance of sleep in developmental plasticity, we sought to examine sleep behavior in two animal models of single gene neurodevelopmental disorders, FXS and TSC. We used home cage monitoring to investigate total sleep times during the light and dark phases. We found that Fmr1 KO mice at two and six months of age sleep less than WT mice in the light phase. In younger animals (at P21), we found no difference between Fmr1 KO and WT mice in sleep times. Sleep deficits were not restored by treatment with a GABA-B agonist, R-baclofen. Ongoing studies will address the ability of other drugs to improve sleep and improve behavioral phenotypes. Future studies will also address sleep in other single gene neurodevelopmental disorders.

Risk factors for developing mental disorders include adverse life events and physiological challenges imposed by drugs, toxicants, and infections. Such stressors and challenges produce cellular changes in brain regions comprising emotional circuits, contributing to altered affect and behavior that underlie affective disorders. Both psychological stressors and physiological challenges, especially when present chronically, affect the brain directly and also indirectly via interactions between the brain and the endocrine and immune systems with which the brain is interconnected. Thus, stressors alter activity within the endocrine and immune systems, and these alterations in turn feed back onto the brain to affect the emotional circuitry. The research in our lab focuses on key components of the interaction between the brain and the immune system in mice undergoing psychosocial stress imposed in ethologically relevant paradigms. Our goal is to define the key cellular and molecular elements that are engaged in emotional circuits when an animal responds to acute and chronic stress and to immune challenges. Behavioral, histochemical, biochemical, and molecular tools are employed to reveal these changes. We study how neuroimmune alterations may contribute to an animal's susceptibility or resilience to stress. Understanding the cellular and molecular factors differentially controlling the outcomes in question may help guide development of interventions aimed at treating mental disorders, notably depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress that arise as a consequence of psychosocial, pathophysiological, and immunological challenges.

Chronic psychosocial stress has been implicated in the etiology and progression of psychiatric disorders such as major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In mice, we study the effects of psychosocial stress in a conflict paradigm that leads to behavioral alterations manifested as social avoidance, anhedonia, anxiety, and depressive-like states. In our chronic social defeat (CSD) paradigm, two male mice are placed in a continuous dyadic living relationship in which the subordinate experimental mouse is chronically exposed to and periodically defeated by a dominant mouse. Over the course of weeks in this living situation, the experimental mouse develops anxious and depressive-like behaviors that are associated with distinct neurochemical alterations in identified brain circuits. A decreased rate of hippocampal neurogenesis is one well-documented readout of CSD stress effects. Thus the paradigm is an ethologically relevant and validated model that can provide insights into the bases for mental illness in humans. We are beginning to address sex as a biological variable because psychiatric disorders show skewing of incidence by sex.  We are currently adapting the CSD model to work in female mice, and we plan to evaluate the outcomes in both sexes.Our research focuses on the roles played by immune factors in the etiology of psychosocial stress-induced depressive states. We hypothesize that there is a bidirectional dialog between the brain and the immune system that serves to maintain homeostasis in healthy states, but disturbances within this dialog lead to homeostatic corrections or dysfunction that contribute to the onset and course of psychiatric disease. Therefore, we measure immune system parameters as we manipulate psychosocial processes that affect brain states. We have two projects that investigate immune changes in rodents undergoing psychological stress; one focuses on the role of the adaptive immune system in maintaining homeostatic balance during chronic stress, and the second investigates stress-induced changes in immune cells and molecules within the brain itself.1) We conducted experiments aimed at addressing the role of the adaptive immune system in controlling mood states in the CSD model. The adaptive immune system, separate from the innate immune system, comprises lymphocytes that adapt toi.e., acquire and retain a memory ofprior challenges. We wondered whether lymphocytes might retain a memory of a stressful event, and if so, what effect might that might have on the brain and behavior.  Lymphocytes normally reside in lymphoid organs and the blood, and they do not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enter the brain.  Surprisingly however, lymphocytes appear to exert effects on the brain and behavior as suggested by results of our lymphocyte transfer experiments. We published a novel approach to the question of adaptive immune system influence on the brain by studying the mutant Rag2-/- mouse, which has no adaptive immune system because it lacks a gene needed to produce mature lymphocytes. We transferred into this lymphopenic mouse lymphocytes from normal donor mice that had either been chronically stressed or unstressed, and after two weeks of lymphocyte reconstitution in the host mouse, behavioral tests and hippocampal cell proliferation assays were performed. The Rag2-/- mice that received cells from defeated mice showed anti-depressive and anxiolytic behaviors relative to mice that received no cell transfer or transfer of cells from home-cage control mice. These surprising findings suggested that the adaptive immune system retains a memory for adverse events and attempts to return the host animal to a condition of homeostasis. Current work examines the molecular and cellular determinants of the interaction and the anatomical and humoral pathways by which the immune system affects brain function and structure. We are particularly focused on the meninges as a site of interaction between the periphery and the brain. The meninges are a special component of the BBB because peripheral immune cellsleukocytesonly very sparsely enter the brain parenchyma but do reside in the subarachnoid spaces of the meninges, on the brain side of the BBB, where they can release bioactive molecules that circulate throughout the brain in the interstitial cerebrospinal fluid to potentially influence brain activity. We track leukocytes in the meninges using whole-mount meningeal preparations for histochemistry and flow cytometry for cell type analysis. We characterize activation states and gene expression profiles in these cells. Our analysis of cells in CSD stressed versus nonstressed animals has shown that stress alters the make-up of meningeal lymphocytes, skewing them in ways that suggest a pro-inflammatory phenotype.  Similar studies are now directed at the meninges of Rag2-/- mice that received adoptive transfer.  Pro- and anti-inflammatory lymphocyte phenotypes can be programmed in vitro, and thus parallel studies are underway to introduce programmed cells into Rag2-/- mice to determine whether they confer antidepressant properties. Such studies may lead to insights into new targets for therapeutic interventions in psychiatric disorders. 2) Specialized immune cells within the brain are called microglia, which share properties with peripheral immune cells of hematopoietic origin. Our previous published research documented effects of acute and chronic social defeat stress on microglial proliferation and activation states in the prefrontal cortex. These changes may be one basis for our published finding that chronically stressed mice had reduced levels of myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Stress-induced microglial activation likely alters neuronal function and thereby differentially direct behavioral outcomes associated with either susceptibility or resilience to the effects of the stress. We analyzed microglia isolated by flow cytometry to characterize cell-surface markers of activation and by microarray to assess gene expression patterns. The microarray data indicated that microglia isolated from defeated mice that had been susceptible (CSD-S) to the depressive effects of social defeat were functionally distinct from microglia taken from defeated mice that showed behavioral resilience (CSD-R) to the stress procedure. The microglial gene expression characteristics of the CSD-R group were more like those from unstressed home cage (HC) control mice, suggesting that microglial activity contributes to the brain states that afford resilience to the effects of psychosocial stress. Gene expression profiles in the microglia from CSD-S mice showed evidence of inflammation, phagocytosis, extracellular matrix breakdown, oxidative stress, and extravasation. The microarray findings were confirmed by histochemical and ex vivo assay methods. In the CSD-S mice only, local breeches of the BBB and brain micro-bleeds were found. CSD-S mice also showed elevated levels of dihydroethidium (DHE) in cells, indicating increased levels of oxidative stress. Drugs that prevent the conversion of microglia to a reactive pro-inflammatory state seen in the susceptible group may protect the animals from the depressive effects of the defeat stress. In one experiment, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine protected against stress effects. Studies are underway to explore the role played by microglia in these effects by depleting microglia using the CSF-1R antagonist drug PLX5622. The aims of the work are to demonstrate a causal relationship between stress-induced immune alterations and susceptibility or resilience to the stress, and to suggest new therapeutic targets for the treatment of stress-related mood disorders.

We are currently adapting the CSD model to work in female mice, and we plan to evaluate the outcomes in both sexes.Our research focuses on the roles played by immune factors in the etiology of psychosocial stress-induced depressive states. We hypothesize that there is a bidirectional dialog between the brain and the immune system that serves to maintain homeostasis in healthy states, but disturbances within this dialog lead to homeostatic corrections or dysfunction that contribute to the onset and course of psychiatric disease. Therefore, we measure immune system parameters as we manipulate psychosocial processes that affect brain states. We have two projects that investigate immune changes in rodents undergoing psychological stress; one focuses on the role of the adaptive immune system in maintaining homeostatic balance during chronic stress, and the second investigates stress-induced changes in immune cells and molecules within the brain itself.1) We conducted experiments aimed at addressing the role of the adaptive immune system in controlling mood states in the CSD model. The adaptive immune system, separate from the innate immune system, comprises lymphocytes that adapt toi.e., acquire and retain a memory ofprior challenges. We wondered whether lymphocytes might retain a memory of a stressful event, and if so, what effect might that might have on the brain and behavior.  Lymphocytes normally reside in lymphoid organs and the blood, and they do not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to enter the brain.  Surprisingly however, lymphocytes appear to exert effects on the brain and behavior as suggested by results of our lymphocyte transfer experiments. We published a novel approach to the question of adaptive immune system influence on the brain by studying the mutant Rag2-/- mouse, which has no adaptive immune system because it lacks a gene needed to produce mature lymphocytes. We transferred into this lymphopenic mouse lymphocytes from normal donor mice that had either been chronically stressed or unstressed, and after two weeks of lymphocyte reconstitution in the host mouse, behavioral tests and hippocampal cell proliferation assays were performed. The Rag2-/- mice that received cells from defeated mice showed anti-depressive and anxiolytic behaviors relative to mice that received no cell transfer or transfer of cells from home-cage control mice. These surprising findings suggested that the adaptive immune system retains a memory for adverse events and attempts to return the host animal to a condition of homeostasis. Current work examines the molecular and cellular determinants of the interaction and the anatomical and humoral pathways by which the immune system affects brain function and structure. We are particularly focused on the meninges as a site of interaction between the periphery and the brain. The meninges are a special component of the BBB because peripheral immune cellsleukocytesonly very sparsely enter the brain parenchyma but do reside in the subarachnoid spaces of the meninges, on the brain side of the BBB, where they can release bioactive molecules that circulate throughout the brain in the interstitial cerebrospinal fluid to potentially influence brain activity. We track leukocytes in the meninges using whole-mount meningeal preparations for histochemistry and flow cytometry for cell type analysis. We characterize activation states and gene expression profiles in these cells. Our analysis of cells in CSD stressed versus nonstressed animals has shown that stress alters the make-up of meningeal lymphocytes, skewing them in ways that suggest a pro-inflammatory phenotype.  Similar studies are now directed at the meninges of Rag2-/- mice that received adoptive transfer.  Pro- and anti-inflammatory lymphocyte phenotypes can be programmed in vitro, and thus parallel studies are underway to introduce programmed cells into Rag2-/- mice to determine whether they confer antidepressant properties. Such studies may lead to insights into new targets for therapeutic interventions in psychiatric disorders. 2) Specialized immune cells within the brain are called microglia, which share properties with peripheral immune cells of hematopoietic origin. Our previous published research documented effects of acute and chronic social defeat stress on microglial proliferation and activation states in the prefrontal cortex. These changes may be one basis for our published finding that chronically stressed mice had reduced levels of myelination in the prefrontal cortex. Stress-induced microglial activation likely alters neuronal function and thereby differentially direct behavioral outcomes associated with either susceptibility or resilience to the effects of the stress. We analyzed microglia isolated by flow cytometry to characterize cell-surface markers of activation and by microarray to assess gene expression patterns. The microarray data indicated that microglia isolated from defeated mice that had been susceptible (CSD-S) to the depressive effects of social defeat were functionally distinct from microglia taken from defeated mice that showed behavioral resilience (CSD-R) to the stress procedure. The microglial gene expression characteristics of the CSD-R group were more like those from unstressed home cage (HC) control mice, suggesting that microglial activity contributes to the brain states that afford resilience to the effects of psychosocial stress. Gene expression profiles in the microglia from CSD-S mice showed evidence of inflammation, phagocytosis, extracellular matrix breakdown, oxidative stress, and extravasation. The microarray findings were confirmed by histochemical and ex vivo assay methods. In the CSD-S mice only, local breeches of the BBB and brain micro-bleeds were found. CSD-S mice also showed elevated levels of dihydroethidium (DHE) in cells, indicating increased levels of oxidative stress. Drugs that prevent the conversion of microglia to a reactive pro-inflammatory state seen in the susceptible group may protect the animals from the depressive effects of the defeat stress. In one experiment, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine protected against stress effects. Studies are underway to explore the role played by microglia in these effects by depleting microglia using the CSF-1R antagonist drug PLX5622. The aims of the work are to demonstrate a causal relationship between stress-induced immune alterations and susceptibility or resilience to the stress, and to suggest new therapeutic targets for the treatment of stress-related mood disorders.

One prominent feature of emotional disorders is the failure to interpret sensory stimuli in a consistent and realistic manner, for example, when depressed individuals find normally attractive scenes or items such as a favorite food, pet or family member uninteresting or even irritating. It would be helpful to know how normal perceptions arise to design strategies for ameliorating these negative feelings. To address this class of problems, we are studying how information about visual stimuli is coded and utilized. The fundamental elements for information processing in the brain, the neurons, process and carry information by working with a series of impulses, where different numbers of pulses represent different messages. No one neuron carries very much information so the information represented in the messages of different neurons must be integrated to give rise to mental events such as sensation, memory, and coordinated movements. To understand how these higher functions arise, for example, visual perception, it is important to identify the aspects of neuronal responses that carry information important for stimulus coding, and how that information is used for stimulus identification and recognition in cognitive processes. This requires learning what codes are used by individual neurons, how the information they represent is processed and transformed, and how the information is integrated across populations of connected neurons. Therefore, we combine studies of single neurons, multiple neurons and behavior, to learn how higher functions such as visual perception and memory arise.

","Neural Coding of Visual Stimuli


","Section on Neural Coding and Computation, NIMH","
Over the past half century, it has been shown that damage to the lateral inferior temporal cortex, areas TE and TEO, interferes with the ability of monkeys to integrate visual features into identifiable objects. Given this history, when we removed either TE or TEO, the architectonically defined inferior temporal regions, we were surprised that the monkeys had only moderate impairments in placing visual stimuli into categories based on perceptual similarity. Furthermore, when the monkeys gained just a little familiarity with the specific sets, the deficit became substantially milder. Now we have tested whether combining damage of both TE and TEO would result in a severe deficit of the type we had originally expected with TE removal.As in the earlier studies, we used stimuli made up from morphed (blended and warped) images of cats and dogs ranging between 0 and 100% dog, with a distribution biased around the category boundary (11 levels, 0, 25, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 75, 100% of dog). The monkeys had to touch a bar to initiate trial. We compared the behavioral data collected 10 days before the TE+TEO removals, with the data collected 10 days after recovery from surgery. Combined TE+TEO removal produced a severe impairment in visual categorization that showed only a small amount of recovery across the 10 post-surgical testing days. Despite this profound deficit in categorization of the morphed stimuli, these monkeys did not show any impairment in either discriminating two black and white checkerboard patterns, or in a test of visual acuity where the monkeys had to indicate whether a faint striped pattern was present, that is, a test for contrast sensitivity. Thus, combined TE+TEO removal does not affect low-level visual function but does lead to a profound loss of high-level visual categorization in monkeys.Another aspect of vision that plays an important role in daily life and is studied in old-world monkeys is visual short-term memory. Recently we showed that monkeys and humans seem to use different strategies for short-term memory tasks. Rhesus monkeys rely heavily on recency of stimulus repetition to solve visual short-term memory tasks, whereas humans rely heavily on specific memorization. In the past we have also shown that monkeys can integrate the identity of images across visual noise, although as the amount of noise increases the performance decreases. In five old-world monkeys (two Rhesus monkeys and three Japanese monkeys) we studied whether the presence of visual noise interacted with short-term memory. A sequence of visual stimuli (2-5) was presented. The monkeys were required to report whether the test (last) stimulus matched the first stimulus in the sequence by releasing a bar in the primate chair if they matched. We superimposed random dot visual noise on the test stimuli to degrade the stimuli patterns. We previously found that the behavioral performance of Rhesus monkeys was affected by the amount of visual noise.Both Rhesus and Japanese monkeys were affected by the noise, with the three Japanese monkeys performing better than either of the two Rhesus monkeys. In line with the earlier studies, the performance of both species was affected by the number of stimuli in the trial. In the assessment of working memory, all of the monkeys performed better in shorter trials, suggesting that they were relying on recency to perform. In addition, the error rate increased significantly when the matched stimulus in the previous trial was presented as the test stimulus in the current trial. These results seem to show a strong recency effect in a visual recognition task in both species of monkey, an effect unaffected by visual noise on the test stimulus.Manipulating the activity of neurons during experiments is an important technical approach to studying the relation between neural structures and behavior. Ideally a technique would be specific, and reversible. New tools coming from molecular genetics offer the opportunity to develop such tools for use in primates. We have pioneered the development of one agent, the DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug), to silence neurons. It would be helpful to have other agents. Artificially introduced ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) have been used in the mouse to inactivate selected brain regions repeatedly and non-invasively. When the anthelmintic drug ivermectin (IVM) is applied, cells expressing GluCl become hyperpolarized because the cell membrane has a functional leak in a type of chloride channel. In monkeys, GluCl can be expressed in an area of interest using replication-deficient viral vectors to carry the gene into the neurons. After infecting neurons with this viral construct, systemic injection of IVM causes neurons expressing GluCl to become hyperpolarized, thereby silencing the target region. We injected lentivirus vectors expressing GluCl/IVM into primary visual cortex of two rhesus monkeys. We also removed a region of contralateral visual cortex symmetrical to the AAV2 injection site by aspiration as a positive control. After recovery from surgery, the monkeys performed a signal detection task. On 80% of trials, a high-contrast target was presented in one hemifield and a lower-contrast distractor was presented symmetrically about the vertical meridian. The monkeys were supposed to saccade to the brighter cue to obtain a liquid reward. The monkeys failed to saccade to the target when it was presented in the scotoma corresponding to the aspiration removal. This was accompanied by an increase in the number of saccades to the distractor presented in the symmetrically opposite site. When we administered injected IVM (7.5 mg/kg) 24 hours prior to testing, the monkeys also failed to detect the distractor in the opposite hemifield (i.e. in the receptive field corresponding to the region of V1 expressing GluCl). Thus, we have shown that the technology for Glu/IVM channels can be used to silence neurons reversibly and repeatedly in the primate visual system.

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the neural mechanisms mediating selective visual attention. In particular, we aim to understand how behaviorally relevant visual information is processed in the brain and how distracting information is effectively filtered out. To do so, we employ various experimental approaches in behaving subjects, including brain imaging in humans and monkeys as well as single-unit recordings in monkeys. The behavioral paradigms we develop in normal, healthy individuals are applied to human populations with attentional impairments, such as children suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by pervasive inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that often results in substantial functional impairment, both in and outside of the classroom. Prevalence estimates of ADHD in school-aged children are close to 10%, with more than half of those diagnosed reported to be taking medication for the disorder. Hence, a thorough understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying attention would have important public health implications. This work was conducted under protocol 10-M-0047 (NCT01087281) and 93-M-0170 (NCT00001360).

","Functional Anatomy of Perceptual and Attentional Systems in the Primate Brain


","Section on Neurocircuitry, NIMH","
A typical scene contains many different objects that compete for neural representation due to the limited processing capacity of the visual system. At the neural level, competition among multiple objects is evidenced by the mutual suppression of their visually evoked responses. The competition among multiple objects can be biased by both bottom-up sensory-driven mechanisms (exogenous attention), such as stimulus salience, and top-down, goal-directed influences, such as selective, endogenous attention. Although the competition among multiple objects for representation is ultimately resolved within visual cortex, the source of top-down biasing signals likely derives from a distributed network of areas in frontal and parietal cortex. Classic theories of object-based attention (selection of one object in the context of competing distracters) assume a single object of selection but real-world tasks, such as driving a car, often require attending to multiple objects simultaneously. However, whether object-based attention can operate on more than one object at a time remains unexplored. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to address this question as human participants performed object-based attention tasks that required simultaneous attention to two objects differing in either their features or locations. Simultaneous attention to two objects differing in features (face and house) did not show significantly different responses in the fusiform face area (FFA) or parahippocampal place area (PPA), respectively, compared to attending a single object (face or house), but did enhance the response in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Simultaneous attention to two circular arcs differing in locations did not show significantly different responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) compared to attending a single circular arc but did enhance the response in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). These results suggest that object-based attention can simultaneously select at least two objects differing in their features or locations, processes mediated by the frontal and parietal cortex, respectively.Feature-based attention can influence responses to stimuli outside and contralateral to the attended location that share features with the attended stimulus, which demonstrates the spatially global effect of feature-based attention. However, how feature-based attention modulates neural responses in cortical areas from attended to unattended locations remains unclear. Here we used fMRI to investigate the underlying mechanism of this spatially global effect as human participants performed motion- (Experiment 1) and color- (Experiment 2) attention tasks. In Experiment 1, subjects were asked to attend one direction of motion within a display of overlapping upward and downward moving dots (the attended stimulus) on one side of a central fixation point, and ignore a single field of dots moving either up or down (the ignored stimulus) on the other side. In Experiment 2, the attended stimulus was comprised of overlapping fields of stationary red and green dots on one side of central fixation, and the ignored stimulus was a single field of red or green dots on the other side. Our results showed that, in both experiments, early visual, parietal, and prefrontal areas, as well as their respective sensory areas (MT+ for motion and V4 for color) all showed the classical feature-based attentional effect, with responses to the ignored stimulus significantly elevated when it shared the same feature as the attended stimulus. Using effective connectivity analysis, we found that the inferior frontal junction played a significant role in the spatially global effect of feature-based attention, indicating that this region is the neural substrate for the effect. Visuospatial attention often improves task performance by increasing signal gain at attended locations and decreasing noise at unattended locations. Attention is also believed to be the mechanism that allows information to enter awareness. In this behavioral experiment, we assessed whether orienting endogenous visuospatial attention with cues differentially affects visual discrimination sensitivity (an objective task performance) and visual awareness (the subjective feeling of perceiving) during the same discrimination task. Gabor patch targets were presented laterally, either at low contrast (contrast stimuli) or at high contrast embedded in noise (noise stimuli). Participants reported their orientation either in a 3-alternative choice task (clockwise, counterclockwise, unknown) that allowed for both objective and subjective reports, or in a 2-alternative choice task (clockwise, counterclockwise) that provided a control for objective reports. Signal detection theory models were fit to the experimental data: estimated perceptual sensitivity reflected objective performance; decision criteria, or subjective biases, were a proxy for visual awareness. Attention increased sensitivity (i.e., improved objective performance) for the contrast, but not for the noise stimuli. Indeed, with the latter, attention did not further enhance the already high target signal or reduce the already low uncertainty on its position. Interestingly, for both contrast and noise stimuli, attention resulted in more liberal criteria, i.e., awareness increased. The noise condition is thus an experimental configuration where people think they see the targets they attend to better, even if they do not. This could be explained by an internal representation of their attentional state, which influences awareness independent of objective visual signals.Finally, in this last project, fMRI data were acquired to explore the neural substrate of fine-grained awareness content and aimed to isolate it from well-known visual and attention networks. Here, the results showed that fronto-parietal and early visual areas in the human brain displayed a dichotomic pattern of activation, reflecting an ignition when participants become able to identify an image. A more gradual build-up of activation in parallel to the gradual identification of the images presented, was present in both the fronto-parietal network and along the ventra; visual pathway. Finally, the temporo-parietal junction appeared to be more active when participants are more confident of their choice (i.e., in identifying or not detecting an item). The results of this study help to clarify discrepancies in the literature by revealing how the neural correlates of consciousness depend on the specific question asked of the participant.

In this behavioral experiment, we assessed whether orienting endogenous visuospatial attention with cues differentially affects visual discrimination sensitivity (an objective task performance) and visual awareness (the subjective feeling of perceiving) during the same discrimination task. Gabor patch targets were presented laterally, either at low contrast (contrast stimuli) or at high contrast embedded in noise (noise stimuli). Participants reported their orientation either in a 3-alternative choice task (clockwise, counterclockwise, unknown) that allowed for both objective and subjective reports, or in a 2-alternative choice task (clockwise, counterclockwise) that provided a control for objective reports. Signal detection theory models were fit to the experimental data: estimated perceptual sensitivity reflected objective performance; decision criteria, or subjective biases, were a proxy for visual awareness. Attention increased sensitivity (i.e., improved objective performance) for the contrast, but not for the noise stimuli. Indeed, with the latter, attention did not further enhance the already high target signal or reduce the already low uncertainty on its position. Interestingly, for both contrast and noise stimuli, attention resulted in more liberal criteria, i.e., awareness increased. The noise condition is thus an experimental configuration where people think they see the targets they attend to better, even if they do not. This could be explained by an internal representation of their attentional state, which influences awareness independent of objective visual signals.Finally, in this last project, fMRI data were acquired to explore the neural substrate of fine-grained awareness content and aimed to isolate it from well-known visual and attention networks. Here, the results showed that fronto-parietal and early visual areas in the human brain displayed a dichotomic pattern of activation, reflecting an ignition when participants become able to identify an image. A more gradual build-up of activation in parallel to the gradual identification of the images presented, was present in both the fronto-parietal network and along the ventra; visual pathway. Finally, the temporo-parietal junction appeared to be more active when participants are more confident of their choice (i.e., in identifying or not detecting an item). The results of this study help to clarify discrepancies in the literature by revealing how the neural correlates of consciousness depend on the specific question asked of the participant.

Neuropeptides and biogenic amines, acting as slow transmitters at neuronal synapses, modulate synaptic efficacy underlying brain and peripheral nervous system function. The Section on Molecular Neuroscience identifies novel cellular signaling component, and novel aspects of combinatorial activation of signaling proteins, through which neuropeptides and biogenic amines exert this modulation, and we develop pharmacological reagents to inhibit or stimulate those components for therapeutic effect in vivo. The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) through its PAC1 receptor and dopamine (DA) through its D1 receptor elevate post-synaptic cyclic AMP (through Gs) after secretion from pre-synaptic neurons. We have identified in cell culture the parcellation of cAMP signaling through these receptors based in independent activation of one of three cAMP sensor/effectors, protein kinase A (PKA), Epac, or NCS-Rapgef2. The latter is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor recently shown by us to be expressed exclusively in neuronal and endocrine cells in adult rodents, and in human endocrine and neuronal cells, and to mediate activation of the MAP kinase ERK in these cells. As a previous prevailing view held that cAMP in neurons signaling only through the  cAMP effector PKA, we are examining the unique features of cAMP signaling that in neurons is parcellated via NCS-Rapgef2 and Epac to cellular functions distinct from those activated by PKA (see Jiang et al., eNeuro 4(5) e0248-17.2017 1-17). We have so far learned that ERK elevation in multiple brain nuclei in response to stress or psychomotor stimulant treatment is completed abrogated by knocking out NCS-Rapgef2 expression in those neurons, without demonstrable effect on the targets of other cAMP effectors (e.g. CREB targeted by PKA) which are activated by the same stimuli. So, it is our wish in the coming year to fully investigate the role of NCS-Rapgef2 in the behaviors elicited by stress and by psychomotor stimulant treatment. We hypothesize that a number of these behaviors will be dependent on the expression of NCS-Rapgef2, the critical link between cAMP elevation and ERK activation in neurons of the central nervous system, and that pharmacological manipulation in vivo using newly discovered specific inhibitors of NCS-Rapgef2 (see Emery et al., ACS Chemical Neuroscience 8: 1500, 2017), will provide new insights into the parcellation of intraneuronal signaling in the brain, and the potential for modulation of specific subsets of behaviors elicited by stress and chronic psychomotor stimulation administration, including depressive and addictive ones.

","Chemical Coding of Neurotransmission


","Section on Molecular Neuroscience, NIMH","
The publications resulting from our activities of the past year are listed in the accompanying bibliography. They demonstrate our interest in specific signaling molecules that allow neurons to communicate with one another in highly specific ways that are experience-dependent, and allow behavioral plasticity and adaptability. For example, we have mapped the hypothalamic hormone vasopressin to nerve terminals at new locations in the brain (e.g. lateral habenula) using single-cell labeling of the cell bodies of these neurons at their source in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, and characterized co-expressed transmitters and enzymes, including the aromatase that converts testosterone to estrogen in the brain. These neurochemical characterizations have been used to demonstrate that in gonadectomized mice, the vasopressin projections to lateral habenula are lost, as is corresponding activation of LHb neurons after stress.  Hormone replacement therapy (testosterone treatment) restores both behavioral effects and vasopressin projections to Lab, suggesting that this projection system exerts actions on animal responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli in a sex steroid (gonadal status)-dependent way (Zhang et al., 2018). We have also identified co-expression of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter markers in neurons that contain the stress-associated peptide PACAP in rodent brain, suggesting that co-transmission is an underlying mechanism for PACAP actions on stress-induced relapse to drug-seeking behaviors, as well as stress-induced depresssogenic behaviors that are PACAP-dependent (i.e. are abrogated in PACAP-deficient mice). With our colleagues at the University of Marburg, the University of Illinois, and the Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM) we have shown (Zhang, Gillette, Weihe and Eiden, in preparation) that glutamate co-release with PACAP in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is responsible for light-induced (mimicked by glutamate administration in ex vivo SCN preparations) phase shifts in the level of activation of this nucleus, relevant to cooperation between two transmitters-- peptide and an excitatory amino acid--in mediating behavioral plasticity associated with seasonal adaptation in the mouse. In other work, we have determined a mechanism, receptor-specific desensitization, to explain how G-protein coupled receptors for biogenic amines and neuropeptides can differentially activate a neuronal-specific pathway to MAP kinase activation in neuroendocrine cells through the neuronally-expressed guanine nucleotide exchange factor NCS-Rapgef2 (Jiang et al., eNeuro, 2017). This pathway is required (i.e. activation is abrogated by down-regulation of NCS-Rapgef2) for ERK activation in response to cocaine or amphetamine in D1 dopaminoceptive neurons of the nucleus accumbens, a critical center for reward and addiction in the brain. Our results further predict that In the brain stimulation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine (as for D1 receptors by dopamine) activates the neuronal MAP kinase ERK, while stimulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine does not activate this pathway. Activation of the neuronal ERK pathway in dopamine-responsive neurons allows the expression of neuronal plasticity (incorporation of experience into altered circuit properties and emergent behaviors) in rodents, including locomotor sensitization to cocaine and preference for cocaine imbibition, a surrogate for cocaine dependence. We are currently verifying the effects of NCS-Rapgef2 inhibition in nucleus accumbens on these behaviors associated with cocaine ingestion. If successful, we will extend this work to examination of differential effects of beta-1 and beta-2 receptor activation on norepinephrine-dependent behaviors in other brain regions.Finally, we have begun a multi-year and difficult project, but one as yet unassayed by other laboratories, to causally link changes in the morphology of neuronal dendrites-- changes in shape and number of dendritic spines--to specific behaviors including psychomotor stimulant drug dependence.

Research in the Section on Neuroanatomy is concerned with the functional organization of neural brain systems, with a particular interest in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. This forebrain neural system receives inputs from all cortical areas and processes that input through the striatum. The striatum's output pathways provide feedback, through the thalamus, to cortical areas involved in the selection and control of behavior. Our work uses neuroanatomical methods to study the connectional organization of the basal ganglia to study the regulation of gene expression responsible for neuronal plasticity within the striatum. Work in our laboratory established that D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes are segregated in the ""direct"" and ""indirect"" striatal output neurons, which is the basis of how dopamine maintains the balanced function of striatal output pathways (Gerfen et al., 1990). Neuromodulators such as dopamine act to alter the long-term response of neurons to synaptic input, such as the glutamatergic excitatory input from the cortex. Such neuroplasticity is mediated by the activation of neurotransmitter receptor-mediated activation of protein kinase signal transduction pathways. This results in the activation of transcription factors and induction of specific genes that are responsible for altering synaptic responses. We demonstrated that in the striatum, the ""direct"" and ""indirect"" striatal projection neurons support distinct forms of neuronal plasticity that affect responses to cortical input, through the differential activation of distinct protein kinase signaling pathways. Dopamine maintains these different forms of response. Dysfunction of the striatum following dopamine lesions in animal models of Parkinson's disease, appears to be due to a particularly aberrant form of neuronal plasticity. The aberrant form is due to a switch in the regulation of a particular protein kinase signal transduction pathway. The purpose of these studies is to better establish how disorders of the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's disease, result in clinical movement disorders, and whether the basal ganglia might also be involved in such mental disorders, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or in the abuse of psychoactive drugs.A major limitation of our research and others research to relate neuroanatomical circuits to both typical and atypical behavior is the complex functional organization of brain circuits. While neuroanatomical studies in our laboratory have unraveled much of the underlying organization of the basal ganglia, research approaches to study the function of these circuits in animal models have been difficult. One promising approach has been the development of genetically engineered transgenic mouse lines in which the enzyme Cre-recombinase is expressed in specific neuron types, neural circuits or brain regions. Combining such expression with floxed constructs enables the ability to experimentally manipulate very specific components of neuroanatomical circuits. These mice are being developed and characterized to provide powerful new research tools to the neuroscience research community. Our contribution to this effort is to characterize the specific pattern of expression of Cre-recombinase as part of the NINDS/NIMH funded GENSAT project.

","Functional Organization of the Cerebral Cortex and Basal Ganglia


","Office of the Director, NIMH","
Advances in molecular genetic techniques are revealing new details of the neuroanatomical organization of brain circuitry and the functional role of these circuits in behavior. Engineered viral vector constructs have been developed to label axonal projections of targeted neurons with unprecedented clarity, while others allow for retrograde trans-synaptic labeling of neurons providing inputs or anterograde trans-synaptic labeling of post-synaptic targets of axonal projections. Development of optogenetic and DREADD techniques provide the ability to functionally manipulate neural circuits to study their role in behavior while calcium indicators provide the ability to analyze the physiologic activity in targeted neuron populations. Together these approaches provide new insights into the functional organization of neural circuits. For example, optogenetic studies, using light activation of Channel Rhodopsin (ChR), have demonstrated the ability to functionally manipulate specific neural pathways to determine their role in behaviors including fear memory, anxiety, feeding, and movement. The analytic potential of these approaches is enhanced by the ability to target specific neuron populations, which are defined components of neural circuits. One approach involves the use of transgenic Cre-driver mouse lines in which Cre-recombinase is expressed under the control of gene-specific promoters. In recent years we characterized BAC-Cre driver lines from the GENSAT project that allow for targeting components of the neural circuits of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia (Gerfen et al., 2013). Of particular significance, lines were characterized with selective labeling in cortical layer 2/3, in layer 4, in layer 5 and in layer 6. Each of these cortical layers contain neuron subtypes with distinct axonal projection patterns. These BAC-Cre lines provide unprecedented ability to study the specific function of these cortical subtypes in behavior.In the past year we collaborated with investigators in NIMH and NEI, at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farms Research, and the University of Pittsburgh in studies that used the BAC-Cre lines to determine the relationship between the organization of information transfer between sensory, motor and association cortical areas and the planning and initiation of movements. During this year neuroanatomical techniques were developed to analyze the functional organization of the relationship between the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Our work focuses on the organization of neural circuits responsible for integrating different modes of sensory and experiential information that is utilized in the planning and execution of behavior. To do this we use viral vectors that label the axons of specific cortical neuron subtypes in GENSAT BAC-Cre mouse lines. Viral vectors injected into different cortical areas in BAC-Cre lines expressing in cortical layers 2/3 and 5a map the connections between functional cortical areas, which are responsible for integration of information, while injections in BAC-Cre lines expressing in layers 5b and 6 label axonal projections to subcortical systems, which are involved in turning cortical activity into behavior. The labeled axons are visualized using immunohistochemical techniques in 50m sections of the brain and imaged to reveal multiple injections in different cortical areas reveal specific patterns of connectivity between functionally distinct cortical areas and subcortical systems. To analyze these complex patterns of connectivity we developed an efficient process for reconstructing the images through the whole mouse brain using the NIH ImageJ program (Paletzki and Gerfen, 2015). These fully reconstructed whole mouse brain image sets displaying the axonal projections of specific neuron subtypes in multiple cortical areas are registered to a common mouse brain atlas. The ability to register patterns of axonal projections obtained from many brains provides the ability to analyze the complex organization of the neural circuits integrating information between functional cortical areas and how it is transmitted to subcortical circuits responsible for behavior (Eastwood et al., 2018). Work with the Janelia MouseLight Project provides an exciting advance in analysis of the connectivity of cortical neural circuits (Economo et al., 2016; Gerfen et al., 2017). The MouseLight Project has developed a platform for tracing the axonal projections of individual cortical neurons through the whole brain. The axonal projections of individual cortical neurons project collaterals to as many as 15 cortical or subcortical areas. In some cases, the total axonal length of an individual neurons axon collaterals has been shown to be 10 to 15 cm, which is quite remarkable considering that the mouse brain is approximately 1.5 cm in length from the frontal cortical pole to the cerebellum.  In a collaborative study with the Svoboda lab at Janelia Research Campus, data from mapping projections of both populations and single layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons in promotor cortical areas identified 2 subtypes based on their selective axonal projections to either thalamus or brainstem motor nuclei (Economo et al, 2018).  Single cell mRNA expression profiling demonstrated specific genetic differences between these subtypes.  In addition, behavioral studies combined with optogenetic stimulation and activity recording showed that the thalamic projecting subtype is involved in the preparatory activity (Guo et al., 2017), preceding goal directed movements, which engage the brainstem projecting cortical neuron subtype. In a collaboration with the Krauzlis lab in NEI, the role of the striatum in perceptual decision-making as distinguished from action selection was studied (Wang et al., 2018).  Using a visual orientation-change detection task combined with selective optogenetic manipulation of either the direct or indirect striatal pathways it was demonstrated that activation of the direct pathway significantly increased the response to the sensory stimulus and not due to a general increase in response initiation.   These results indicate a causal link between the activity in the direct pathway and decision-making dependent on perceptual bias.  With Bryan Hooks at the University of Pittsburgh we studied the organization of cortical inputs to the striatum (Hooks et al., 2018).  Cortico-striatal inputs are organized topographically but do not provide a point to point remapping of the cortex in the striatum.  Rather the projections are distributed over an area within the striatum such that there is convergence of inputs.  This convergence integrates information from different cortical areas, such as from sensory and motor areas. In our study we used Cre-driver lines combined with injections of viral vectors that label axonal projections to map the projections from subtypes of layer 5 cortical neurons into the striatum. Data demonstrated that motor and sensory areas that are inter-connected project to overlapping regions in the striatum.  For example, the upper limb area of the somatosensory cortex projects to a discrete part of the motor cortex, which projects back to the upper limb area of the somatosensory cortex and both of these cortical areas project to overlapping area of the striatum.  The precision of the topographic organization of cortico-striatal inputs decreases along a gradient from primary somatosensory cortex to primary and secondary cortical areas.  Additionally, there is a difference in both the pattern of convergence and the precision of the projections between different subtypes of cortical neurons projecting to the striatum.  These data provide new insights into how information from the cortex is processed through the basal ganglia to affect behavior.

Engineered viral vector constructs have been developed to label axonal projections of targeted neurons with unprecedented clarity, while others allow for retrograde trans-synaptic labeling of neurons providing inputs or anterograde trans-synaptic labeling of post-synaptic targets of axonal projections. Development of optogenetic and DREADD techniques provide the ability to functionally manipulate neural circuits to study their role in behavior while calcium indicators provide the ability to analyze the physiologic activity in targeted neuron populations. Together these approaches provide new insights into the functional organization of neural circuits. For example, optogenetic studies, using light activation of Channel Rhodopsin (ChR), have demonstrated the ability to functionally manipulate specific neural pathways to determine their role in behaviors including fear memory, anxiety, feeding, and movement. The analytic potential of these approaches is enhanced by the ability to target specific neuron populations, which are defined components of neural circuits. One approach involves the use of transgenic Cre-driver mouse lines in which Cre-recombinase is expressed under the control of gene-specific promoters. In recent years we characterized BAC-Cre driver lines from the GENSAT project that allow for targeting components of the neural circuits of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia (Gerfen et al., 2013). Of particular significance, lines were characterized with selective labeling in cortical layer 2/3, in layer 4, in layer 5 and in layer 6. Each of these cortical layers contain neuron subtypes with distinct axonal projection patterns. These BAC-Cre lines provide unprecedented ability to study the specific function of these cortical subtypes in behavior.In the past year we collaborated with investigators in NIMH and NEI, at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farms Research, and the University of Pittsburgh in studies that used the BAC-Cre lines to determine the relationship between the organization of information transfer between sensory, motor and association cortical areas and the planning and initiation of movements. During this year neuroanatomical techniques were developed to analyze the functional organization of the relationship between the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Our work focuses on the organization of neural circuits responsible for integrating different modes of sensory and experiential information that is utilized in the planning and execution of behavior. To do this we use viral vectors that label the axons of specific cortical neuron subtypes in GENSAT BAC-Cre mouse lines. Viral vectors injected into different cortical areas in BAC-Cre lines expressing in cortical layers 2/3 and 5a map the connections between functional cortical areas, which are responsible for integration of information, while injections in BAC-Cre lines expressing in layers 5b and 6 label axonal projections to subcortical systems, which are involved in turning cortical activity into behavior. The labeled axons are visualized using immunohistochemical techniques in 50m sections of the brain and imaged to reveal multiple injections in different cortical areas reveal specific patterns of connectivity between functionally distinct cortical areas and subcortical systems. To analyze these complex patterns of connectivity we developed an efficient process for reconstructing the images through the whole mouse brain using the NIH ImageJ program (Paletzki and Gerfen, 2015). These fully reconstructed whole mouse brain image sets displaying the axonal projections of specific neuron subtypes in multiple cortical areas are registered to a common mouse brain atlas. The ability to register patterns of axonal projections obtained from many brains provides the ability to analyze the complex organization of the neural circuits integrating information between functional cortical areas and how it is transmitted to subcortical circuits responsible for behavior (Eastwood et al., 2018). Work with the Janelia MouseLight Project provides an exciting advance in analysis of the connectivity of cortical neural circuits (Economo et al., 2016; Gerfen et al., 2017). The MouseLight Project has developed a platform for tracing the axonal projections of individual cortical neurons through the whole brain. The axonal projections of individual cortical neurons project collaterals to as many as 15 cortical or subcortical areas. In some cases, the total axonal length of an individual neurons axon collaterals has been shown to be 10 to 15 cm, which is quite remarkable considering that the mouse brain is approximately 1.5 cm in length from the frontal cortical pole to the cerebellum.  In a collaborative study with the Svoboda lab at Janelia Research Campus, data from mapping projections of both populations and single layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons in promotor cortical areas identified 2 subtypes based on their selective axonal projections to either thalamus or brainstem motor nuclei (Economo et al, 2018).  Single cell mRNA expression profiling demonstrated specific genetic differences between these subtypes.  In addition, behavioral studies combined with optogenetic stimulation and activity recording showed that the thalamic projecting subtype is involved in the preparatory activity (Guo et al., 2017), preceding goal directed movements, which engage the brainstem projecting cortical neuron subtype. In a collaboration with the Krauzlis lab in NEI, the role of the striatum in perceptual decision-making as distinguished from action selection was studied (Wang et al., 2018).  Using a visual orientation-change detection task combined with selective optogenetic manipulation of either the direct or indirect striatal pathways it was demonstrated that activation of the direct pathway significantly increased the response to the sensory stimulus and not due to a general increase in response initiation.   These results indicate a causal link between the activity in the direct pathway and decision-making dependent on perceptual bias.  With Bryan Hooks at the University of Pittsburgh we studied the organization of cortical inputs to the striatum (Hooks et al., 2018).  Cortico-striatal inputs are organized topographically but do not provide a point to point remapping of the cortex in the striatum.  Rather the projections are distributed over an area within the striatum such that there is convergence of inputs.  This convergence integrates information from different cortical areas, such as from sensory and motor areas. In our study we used Cre-driver lines combined with injections of viral vectors that label axonal projections to map the projections from subtypes of layer 5 cortical neurons into the striatum. Data demonstrated that motor and sensory areas that are inter-connected project to overlapping regions in the striatum.  For example, the upper limb area of the somatosensory cortex projects to a discrete part of the motor cortex, which projects back to the upper limb area of the somatosensory cortex and both of these cortical areas project to overlapping area of the striatum.  The precision of the topographic organization of cortico-striatal inputs decreases along a gradient from primary somatosensory cortex to primary and secondary cortical areas.  Additionally, there is a difference in both the pattern of convergence and the precision of the projections between different subtypes of cortical neurons projecting to the striatum.  These data provide new insights into how information from the cortex is processed through the basal ganglia to affect behavior.

Our principal objectives are to further our understanding of the roles of the vasopressin 1b receptor (Avpr1b) and oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) in behavior. We expect that our findings will provide novel insights into the actions of vasopressin (Avp) and oxytocin (Oxt) in rodent brain and suggest potential avenues to explore in humans. The role of Oxt in social recognition and affiliation in voles and mice has led to the speculation that a disturbance within the Oxt system may be involved in autism and other social disorders. We have shown that the Avpr1b is expressed almost entirely within the CA2 region of the hippocampus and is especially important for aggression.  We are using regular and conditional knockouts of the Avpr1b and Oxtr to examine the development of behaviors with an unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. We are using various viral delivery systems to express proteins in specific regions of the brain to understand what the roles of these receptors are in particular locations. We recently showed that stimulation of the vasopressinergic pathway to the CA2 area greatly enhances social memory. We are continuing to use optogenetics and electrophysiology to further explore their roles in learning and memory in the hippocampus. We believe that behavioral studies using our knockouts will provide insights fundamental to understanding certain mental illnesses. These could include autism and autism spectrum disorders, dementia, aggression, memory formation, responses to stress, paranoia, and abnormal maternal behaviors.

Affective disorders like depression are highly prevalent (>17% lifetime prevalence) sources of morbidity and mortality, shortening life span by 20 years, accounting for $500 billion annually in direct and indirect costs in the US, and representing a burden of illness worldwide that is second only to heart disease (and anticipated to be the leading cause of disability worldwide by 2020). Depression risk increases during the perimenopause, and depression is cited as a primary reason for resuming menopausal hormone therapy (HT). Community-based epidemiologic studies demonstrate an association between the menopause transition and a 1.5 to 3-fold increased risk of first onset and recurrent depressions in women compared with the premenopause (and in some studies, those who are several years postmenopausal). Importantly, these studies also demonstrate that most women experience no significant symptoms of depression during the menopause transition. The appearance of mood disorders that are specifically linked to the menopause transition suggests that hormonal events accompanying this stage of life might underlie the affective dysregulation that occurs in some women. Indeed, longitudinal studies have observed a relationship between changes in reproductive function and the severity of mood symptoms in depressed perimenopausal women. The development of depression at midlife is important for several reasons. First, in addition to the well-documented morbidity related to an episode of depression, depression conveys an increased risk for all-cause mortality in women at midlife as well as the risk for several specific medical illnesses relevant to women at midlife including osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, evidence suggests that even the presence of minor depression in a menopausal woman can increase cardiovascular mortality by up to 50 percent relative to non-depressed postmenopausal women. Second, during the past decade there has been an increase in the suicide rate at midlife in women suggesting depression at this time frequently goes unrecognized or is considered a normal accompaniment of the menopause transition. Third, reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders represent distinct subtypes of depression, since the appearance of symptoms is linked to a change in reproductive function. Finally, the identification of novel therapeutic interventions in these conditions will narrow existing treatment gaps for the many women who experience these conditions. Thus, our studies provide an unparalleled opportunity to uncover the biological and environmental underpinnings of susceptibility to affective dysregulation. The specific goals and objectives for this project are as follows: 1) Define the role of estradiol withdrawal in the precipitation of depression during the perimenopause. 2) Identify the predictors of the development of depression in the context of menopause-related hypogonadism. 3) Determine the mood and behavioral effects of selective estrogen receptor beta modulators in perimenopause-related depression. 4) Characterize the clinical characteristics and functional impact of disturbances in mood and behavior occurring in the context of ovarian failure.The long-range goals are to identify the mechanisms underlying the effects of gonadal steroids on affective state regulation and the effects of aging on the behavioral and neuroregulatory effects (HPA axis regulation, regional cerebral blood flow) of hypogonadism and gonadal steroid replacement in women.

This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00030147, NCT00060736, NCT00001231, and NCT00001322.  Our findings to date show that PMD is accompanied by a decreased QOL, decreased social adjustment and impaired role functioning comparable to depression occurring at other stages of a womans life. However, neither perimenopausal reproductive status alone nor the presence of hot-flushes had a significant negative impact on QOL measures. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the clinical characteristics we identified reflect pre-existing risk factors for PMD or the effects of a current depression. Preliminary data from our longitudinal study of women transitioning through the menopause clarifies this relationship in part. We examined whether the changes in negative life events and declines in QOL measures observed in cross-sectional studies were antecedents of PMD or reflect the effects of the presence of depression. We prospectively evaluated healthy women longitudinally across the menopause transition. Seventy-six asymptomatic, premenopausal women, ages 41-55 years, were monitored longitudinally for an average of 5.2 years until 6-12 months after their final menses (FMP). Outcome measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), as well as standardized measures of QOL and life events. Twenty-nine episodes of major or minor depression occurred in twenty-three women, twenty-seven of these episodes occurred in the 2-years surrounding the FMP. Thus, confirming previous reports of the clustering of depressions during the late menopause transition a time associated with declining levels of ovarian estradiol secretion. During the four years prior to the FMP, compared to women who remained asymptomatic, women with PMD reported significantly lower life satisfaction in PMD but did not report significant differences in overall QOL, marital satisfaction, experience of personal loss, or negative life events. These data suggest that negative life events and decreased QOL/marital dissatisfaction do not uniformly precede the onset of PMD. Further, the relative absence of antecedent social or environmental events in PMD suggests a more specific role for hormonal events in the triggering of PMD. Preliminary findings from this longitudinal study also suggest that declining adrenal androgens (i.e., dehydroepiandrosterone) and progesterone-derived neurosteroids (i.e., allopregnanolone) could contribute to this risk for PMD. Fifteen additional women should complete this study over the next 1-2 years and at that time we will be better able to characterize the roles of these hormones in the risk for PMD.A role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by the clustering of depressive episodes during the late menopause transition (the stage of ovarian aging associated with maximal decline of ovarian estradiol secretion) and by estradiols antidepressant efficacy in PMD. Additionally, we have completed a subsequent placebo-controlled study examining the effects on mood and behavior in women with PMD of estradiol and two compounds: the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM), raloxifene and a phytoestrogen (plant-derived estrogen-like compounds). In this study we replicated our previous findings that estradiol therapy is effective in the treatment of PMD; however, neither raloxifene nor the phytoestrogen showed significant effects on symptoms in PMD. Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence that estradiol withdrawal precipitates depressive episodes in those women who develop PMD. In our hormone manipulation studies, we evaluated the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with and those without a past PMD. In this study, asymptomatic postmenopausal women who experienced a depression during the menopause transition and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with no past depression received a standard dose of estradiol (100 mcg per day). After three weeks all women were randomly assigned under double-blind (DB) conditions to either continue estradiol or switch to placebo (estradiol withdrawal). If estradiol withdrawal was a relevant physiologic event to trigger depression, then one would predict that depressive symptoms would develop in those women randomized to placebo. Additionally, if women who develop depression during the perimenopause are differentially susceptible to the mood destabilizing effects of estradiol withdrawal, then mood symptoms should emerge in the women with past PMD but not the controls randomized to DB placebo.Results demonstrate that estradiol withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with past PMD (n = 26), but not in those without such a history (n = 30).  Women with past PMD (but not those without past PMD) who were crossed over from estradiol to placebo (i.e., estradiol withdrawal) experienced a significant increase in depression symptom severity. Women with past PMD who continued on estradiol and all control women remained asymptomatic. Importantly, women with past PMD and control women had similar hot-flush severity and plasma estradiol levels during placebo and, therefore, neither differences in hot-flushes (and the attendant sleep-disturbance) nor peripheral estradiol levels account for the differential response to estradiol withdrawal. In women with past PMD, the recurrence of depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women. These data also suggest that women with a history of PMD should be alert to the risk of recurrent depression when discontinuing hormone therapy. In collaboration with David Goldmans laboratory at NIAAA, we are investigating the effects of estradiol withdrawal on gene expression (whole transcriptome RNA-seq) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) obtained from women with past PMD and controls who had the presence and absence, respectively, of estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms confirmed in the clinical study. These studies are performed before and after estradiol withdrawal in LCLs derived from women with past perimenopausal depression (PMD). The goal is to understand possible cellular basis for the differential behavioral response to estradiol withdrawal that was previously demonstrated in our hormone manipulation protocol. Preliminary findings of differential gene expression revealed 534 significant differential gene expression changes between women with past PMD and those with no past PMD after E2 withdrawal, as well as several molecular pathways that appear to be differentially altered in women with PMD. Of these genes, two are of particular interest in PMD: the gene CXCL10, which has been previously linked to cardiovascular disease, is significantly upregulated in women with PMD and the gene CYP7B1, an enzyme which is responsible for the metabolism of the steroids DHEA and pregnenolone (as well as oxysterols, bile acid metabolites with actions on the brain), is also significantly upregulated in women with PMD. Finally, in a recent FDA-approved protocol, we will explore whether the estradiol withdrawal signal is mediated by ER alpha or beta (or both) by employing a selective ER beta agonist. These data could identify a promising new class of therapeutic agents that are safer and more acceptable than estrogen and potentially lack the side effects or withdrawal syndromes associated with traditional psychotropics. Additionally, it is possible that the selectivity of these compounds for estrogen receptor alpha and beta may identify the mechanisms of efficacy of estradiol on specific target symptoms.

Neuropsychiatric disorders involve impairments in representing and manipulating information about self and others. The goal of our research is to elucidate the neural circuits that underpin these abilities in the human brain. Specifically, we seek to identify the neural structures that allow us to quickly and efficiently distinguish self and other animate entities from inanimate objects, and that support our ability to understand complex social interactions. Because these abilities are wholly dependent on prior knowledge (memory), we also seek to identify the neural structures associated with the acquisition, storage, and retrieval processes associated with different types of memory. To accomplish these goals we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure changes in neural activity as subjects perform different types of tasks. We also use these machines to record spontaneous neural activity while subjects are lying quietly to evaluate the brain's intrinsic neurocircuitry. This work was conducted under protocol NCT00001360.

","The Neural Foundations for Memory  and Social Cognition In The Human Brain


","Section on Cognitive Neuropsychology, NIMH","
In the past decade there has been increasing interest in using functional neuroimaging (especially fMRI) to uncover the intrinsic, functional organization of the human brain.  This is often accomplished by collecting data while subjects lie quietly in MRI machines (commonly referred to as resting-state brain scanning). As with all new techniques and procedures, there is considerable debate on how best to analyze these data in order to provide the most valid view of the brain's functional architecture.  During this past year, we have focused considerable effort on these methodological issues by completing a series of investigations aimed at identifying and ridding fMRI of sources of noise known to distort and corrupt the data (Power et al.PNAS,2018;Power et al.,PloS One, 2017; Power et al.,NeuroImage, 2017).  These investigations have yielded important findings on the most promising procedures for collecting and analyzing resting-state data to provide the best possible view of the human brain's intrinsic functional organization.A major limitation of using fMRI, however, is that although this technique has excellent spatial resolution (on the order of millimeters), its temporal resolution is quite poor (on the order of seconds).  To circumvent this limitation, we have turned to MEG to record on-going brain activity with millisecond precision.  Using this technology, we have been able to uncovered a temporal frequency-based map of the entire human cortex based on distinct temporal profiles (Mellem et al., Journal of Neurophysiology, 2017).  This study lays the ground work for future investigations aimed at identifying large-scale brain networks defined by both their spatial and temporal characteristics.    Using these techniques, progress has also been made on understanding the functional organization of ventral temporal cortex.  One of the most robust and oft-replicated findings in cognitive neuroscience is that different regions of ventral temporal cortex respond preferentially to different categories of concrete objects. However, the determinants of this category-related organization remain to be fully established. We, and others, have recently proposed that a major contributing factor to this organization is privileged connectivity from each of these ventral temporal regions to other brain regions that store property information associated with that category. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to define category-related brain regions of interest (ROIs) in a large group of subjects (Stevens et al., 2017). We then used these ROIs in resting-state functional connectivity MRI analyses to explore functional connectivity among these regions. Our results demonstrate that distinct category-preferring regions of ventral temporal cortex show differentially stronger functional connectivity with other regions that have congruent category preferences.  Moreover, the strength of these connections varied with behavior. The better subjects performed on a specific cognitive task like word reading, the stronger the connectivity between regions responsible for visual word identification and language comprehension (Stevens et al., 2017).  These findings support the claim that privileged connectivity with other cortical regions provides a powerful constraint on the category-related organization of this region of the brain.

The desire to act, that is, motivation, arises from the interactions of external factors, e.g., size and timing of reward, and internal factors, e.g., hunger or thirst. Motivation is directly related to the subjective value of reward, and is moderated, or even completely dissipated, if the perceived effort or discomfort seems too great. The normal balance between reward and work is disturbed in many psychiatric disorders, such as depression where feelings of hopelessness make rewards seem not worth pursuing and the work to obtain them too burdensome, or drug abuse where the drug of abuse is so valuable it will be sought even at great danger or cost, both personal and social. We are studying how the value of behavior is modified by the balance between reward value and burden to obtain reward in monkeys. The monkeys naturally vary their performance while we manipulate the reward size and the amount of work needed to obtain reward. We carry out theoretical studies trying to describe the exact balance among these factors, behavioral studies with both normal monkeys and monkeys with selective ablations, single neuron recordings to learn what signals related to these factors are present in different brain regions of the reward system, and genetically-based receptor manipulations to determine what the underlying molecular mechanisms for this behavior are.

","Neural Mechanisms of Motivation and Reward


","Section on Neural Coding and Computation, NIMH","
Previous experiments from our group and others have shown that medial temporal lobe (MTL), orbital prefrontal cortex (OFC), and ventral striatum (VS) play important roles in the integration of visual and reward value information. Damage to any of those structures has an adverse effect on the ability to judge relative reward values, that is, after bilateral damage to any of these structures monkeys have difficulty in recognizing which rewards are biggest (best) and which are worth less.	In our effort to learn how the signals in these interconnected brain regions interact to give rise to reward expectancy, we are using tools from molecular genetics.  We are using nonreplicating viral vectors that carry genes into neurons. We have recently injected the OFC with a lentivirus virus expressing anterogradely transported green fluorescent protein (GFP) and visualized strong projections to both VS and the MTL, identifying a feedforward connection. To identify the feedback connections from OFC to medial temporal lobe, we injected a retrogradely transported Lentivirus (Lenti-Fug-E-syn::GFP) into the OFC projection site of the feedforward expression. In a second monkey, we injected a retrogradely transported Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV-retro-hSyn-GCaMP). Antibody staining for the GFP reporter expression, followed by immunohistochemistry as well as confocal microscopy, revealed common regions of afferent VS and OFC projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and perirhinal cortex (PR). It also showed that area TE, in the anterior temporal lobe, projects strongly to the OFC while there were few cells projecting to the VS. Conversely, there is a dense entorhinal cortex projection to the VS but not to the OFC. We are now using a two-component retrograde virus system expressing (chemogenetic) receptors that allow chemically activated reversible silencing of targeted neurons to examine the functional properties of the projections reported above. Because of our previous work showing the importance of the ventral striatum in reward expectation, and because of the strong projections from both MTL and OFC seen in the viral experiments described above, we recorded neuronal responses from two major classes of VS neurons: TANs (Tonically Active Neurons) and PANs (Phasically Active Neurons) in VS of two monkeys. During the recording the monkeys performed a task in which 9 combinations of reward were offered by combining one reward size (2, 4 or 6 drops of water) with one delay for reward delivery (1, 4 or 7s). A visual cue presented throughout the trial indicated the combination being offered. The monkeys were sensitive to the information about reward size and delay carried by the visual cues: always accepting large rewards with short delays, and mostly refusing small rewards with long delays. The behavior was well-fit by acceptance rate=R/ekD , where R is the reward size in drops, D is the delay in seconds, and k is a free fitting parameter.Our analysis of the neural activity focused on the period immediately following the appearance of the visual cue but before any action were required, approximately the first 750ms after the cue was on. The response of both groups of neurons were analyzed for sensitivity to reward size and delay. When the number of neuronal firings (spike count) was used to measure the responses 31/50 TANs were modulated by the information available in the cue. From visual inspection of the data (rasters) it appeared that the responses of some of the TANs changed their patterns over time, so we used a method that would be sensitive to patterns over time, principal component analysis. This approach showed that the number of neurons sensitive to the reward-delay combination increased from 31 to 44, indicating that many neurons carry information in a temporal code, and that such information can be missed when examining only simple spike counts. This method showed that representing the pattern of the response in time was almost always a better way to measure the responses of TANs.Of the 101 PANS, 68 showed significant spike count modulation in the ANOVA. There were 4 more using PC1 as dependent variable. Thus, it appears that the TANs use a temporal code to convey reward information and the PANs do not. We believe this is an important finding. Ever since Adrian recorded from single neurons, there has been speculation that spike timing or patterns of spikes might carry behaviorally relevant information. Examples where it is clear that timing of spikes carries information are in the sonar system of bats and in the sensory field oscillations of electric fish. In these examples, the neural responses reflect the transformation of information about the outside world to a sensory neural representation. There has been less success in identifying whether the timing within the spike train carries a substantial amount of information for cognitive assessments of events to guide behavior. Here in the TANs, for the first time that we know of, a pure temporal code is used to convey cognitive information. The finding that the TANs, which are interneurons, are neurons with a temporal code is unexpected. Is temporal coding more likely to be a property of interneurons? This finding leaves us with a puzzle. The TANs are thought to influences the response of the PANs. Why do we not see a reflection of the temporal coding the responses of the PANs? We are looking into this issue.

The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch, is working to more clearly define the neurobiology of schizophrenia at the systems level, characterizing abnormalities in implicated neural circuits serving cognitive functions that are disrupted in schizophrenia and their neurochemical underpinnings. In particular, we examine pathophysiology in the frontotemporal system and in systems based on the relationship between subcortical dopamine neurons and cortical activity. This work brings together measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with 15Owater PET, neural activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measurements of in vivo GABA and glutamate levels with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and comprehensive pre- and post-synaptic dopaminergic function with 18FFDOPA, 11CNNC112, and 18Ffallypride PET. This multifaceted approach has the potential to uncover distinctive systems-level phenotypes and mechanisms that may be helpful in the search for susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. This work may ultimately help guide the development of desperately needed new treatments. Because the neural circuits and neurochemical indices that are tested depend upon dopamine and other neurotransmitters that can be affected by neuroleptic medications, patients are studied with these multiple imaging modalities while they are medication-free. The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch inpatient unit and the drug withdrawal protocol in which many of our inpatients participate are critically important to understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly neurochemical features, without the confound of ongoing neuroleptic treatment. The NIMH Intramural Research Program (IRP) is one of the few clinical research facilities where work of this nature can be carried out. Similarly, this special setting allows for close integration with genetic risk discovery efforts. This work provides an active database with which to test the neurobiological implications of genetic factors identified in large consortium studies. Current work in medication-free patients with schizophrenia aims to describe dysfunction of basal-, reward- and executive cognition-related neural activity via fMRI and rCBF studies in relation to clinical indices, illness risk genetics, and measures of presynaptic dopamine stores using 18FFDOPA PET scanning. In addition, to examine the sequelae of a mechanistically different disorder of dopamine regulation, we are assembling a comparison cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease who can tolerate these same neuroimaging procedures while briefly withdrawn from their medications. We further seek to refine our understanding of cortical dopamine function in schizophrenia by incorporating into our research program the radioligands 11CNNC112 and 18Ffallypride, which permit measurement of D1 and D2/3 receptors in the cortex, respectively. This allows us to directly test the theories that cortical dopaminergic tone plays a role in maintaining task appropriate network activity and that the ratio between D1 and D2/3 receptors influences cortical signal-to-noise ratios. These methods for testing the reciprocal subcortical-prefrontal cortex interactions that are strongly implicated in schizophrenia hold great promise for identifying the mechanisms that underlie this and other devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses.Finally, we are also analyzing data obtained from studies aimed at modulating these same networks via novel, personalized therapeutics. These include clinical trials that employed tolcapone and modafinil, two agents that target this implicated neurochemistry and may therefore ameliorate signatures of anomalous prefrontal executive dysfunction in a genetically-defined subgroup of people with schizophrenia.

","Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders with Developmental and Genetic Mechanisms


","Section on Integrative Neuroimaging, NIMH","
The core aim of this project is to elucidate the nature, molecular foundations, underlying neurochemistry, and clinical correlates of neural systems-level dysfunction in schizophrenia. The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branchs recent efforts have included studies examining pathophysiology and phenotypic heterogeneity in patients carefully studied under both medication-free and treated conditions as well as studies of gene-by-environment interactions relevant to schizophrenia pathogenesis.Under this project, we have advanced comprehensive, multimodal positron emission tomography- and magnetic resonance imaging-based studies of a unique and steadily growing cohort of individuals with schizophrenia who have agreed to be studied under placebo (medication-free) conditions. Though this work is necessarily challenging to conduct, we continue to make progress in data collection, which includes characterization of dopamine-dependent mnemonic and reward-related neural responses, striatal presynaptic dopamine synthetic capacity, and both D1 and D2/3 receptor availability, and neurocognitive functioning. These studies provide the opportunity to better understand illness-related neurobiology in a clinically meaningful context, while accounting for medication effects, and to define contributors to the considerable illness heterogeneity observed in schizophrenia, which may ultimately lead to the development of precision, personalized clinical care.  Our recent work integrating assessments of striatal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), presynaptic dopamine synthesis, and clinical ratings during blinded antipsychotic monotherapy and placebo conditions permitted identification of robust medication effects on striatal rCBF that correspond with aspects of clinical treatment response and remains an active area of research.  We found that variability in both physiological and clinical responses to treatment were predicted by the degree of ventral striatal presynaptic dopaminergic tone present, providing novel insights into potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in therapeutic response and laying the groundwork for studies currently underway utilizing magnetoencephalography in this cohort (Eisenberg et al, 2017).In parallel efforts to further understand the extraordinary variability present across individuals with schizophrenia spectrum illness, we have also employed clinical ratings-based cluster analyses in a large cohort of individuals with schizophrenia.  This work identified three reliable clinical subgroups based on symptom profile  low-symptom, deficit, and distress groups  which demonstrated distinct patterns of clinical illness severity, cognitive functioning and personality ratings (Dickinson et al, 2018). We found a parallel pattern of results in subgrouping analyses of symptom data from a childhood-onset schizophrenia sample (Craddock et al, 2018).  Furthermore, in the adult sample, these subgroups were distinguished by differential frontoparietal neural recruitment during working memory performance, suggesting that clinical distinctions between these groups extend to neurobiology.  The importance of this particular phenotype is evident not only in the large body of prior fMRI and PET experimentation from our group characterizing schizophrenia-associated frontoparietal activation abnormalities, but also in our recent collaborative work by demonstrating diminished recruitment of frontoparietal and striatal networks during working memory in inpatients with child-onset schizophrenia (Loeb et al, 2018).  Additional sources of heterogeneity in schizophrenia include environmental exposures during development.  For instance, obstetric/perinatal complications have been linked with schizophrenia risk, and recent work originating from this Branch has yielded major insights into cumulative genetic risk of illness.  We have previously shown that such complications interact with hypoxia-responsive schizophrenia risk genes to affect illness risk, and this year, we report along with collaborators that cumulative effect of the most strongly associated schizophrenia genetic risk loci is greatly amplified in patients with a history of obstetric/perinatal complications (Ursini et al, 2018).   In addition, the extent of exposure to urban environments during childhood has previously been found to increase the risk for schizophrenia to a similar extent as obstetric/perinatal complications. We found that a heritable fMRI measurement of dorsolateral prefrontal function was altered in the urban-reared and, furthermore, was differentially predicted by dopamine-related genetic variation in an urbanicity-dependent manner (Reed et al, 2018).  These gene-environment interactions are the focus of current research in patients under this project.Ongoing work in these directions will prove important for refining models of illness and antipsychotic treatment and will inform novel therapeutic targeting. This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001247,NCT00001486, NCT00044083, NCT00057707

The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch, is working to more clearly define the neurobiology of schizophrenia at the systems level, characterizing abnormalities in implicated neural circuits serving cognitive functions that are disrupted in schizophrenia and their neurochemical underpinnings. In particular, we examine pathophysiology in the frontotemporal system and in systems based on the relationship between subcortical dopamine neurons and cortical activity. This work brings together measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with 15Owater PET, neural activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measurements of in vivo GABA and glutamate levels with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and comprehensive pre- and post-synaptic dopaminergic function with 18FFDOPA, 11CNNC112, and 18Ffallypride PET. This multifaceted approach has the potential to uncover distinctive systems-level phenotypes and mechanisms that may be helpful in the search for susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. This work may ultimately help guide the development of desperately needed new treatments. Because the neural circuits and neurochemical indices that are tested depend upon dopamine and other neurotransmitters that can be affected by neuroleptic medications, patients are studied with these multiple imaging modalities while they are medication-free. The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch inpatient unit and the drug withdrawal protocol in which many of our inpatients participate are critically important to understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, particularly neurochemical features, without the confound of ongoing neuroleptic treatment. The NIMH Intramural Research Program (IRP) is one of the few clinical research facilities where work of this nature can be carried out. Similarly, this special setting allows for close integration with genetic risk discovery efforts. This work provides an active database with which to test the neurobiological implications of genetic factors identified in large consortium studies. Current work in medication-free patients with schizophrenia aims to describe dysfunction of basal-, reward- and executive cognition-related neural activity via fMRI and rCBF studies in relation to clinical indices, illness risk genetics, and measures of presynaptic dopamine stores using 18FFDOPA PET scanning. In addition, to examine the sequelae of a mechanistically different disorder of dopamine regulation, we are assembling a comparison cohort of patients with Parkinson's disease who can tolerate these same neuroimaging procedures while briefly withdrawn from their medications. We further seek to refine our understanding of cortical dopamine function in schizophrenia by incorporating into our research program the radioligands 11CNNC112 and 18Ffallypride, which permit measurement of D1 and D2/3 receptors in the cortex, respectively. This allows us to directly test the theories that cortical dopaminergic tone plays a role in maintaining task appropriate network activity and that the ratio between D1 and D2/3 receptors influences cortical signal-to-noise ratios. These methods for testing the reciprocal subcortical-prefrontal cortex interactions that are strongly implicated in schizophrenia hold great promise for identifying the mechanisms that underlie this and other devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses.Finally, we are also analyzing data obtained from studies aimed at modulating these same networks via novel, personalized therapeutics. These include clinical trials that employed tolcapone and modafinil, two agents that target this implicated neurochemistry and may therefore ameliorate signatures of anomalous prefrontal executive dysfunction in a genetically-defined subgroup of people with schizophrenia. 

The core aim of this project is to elucidate the nature, molecular foundations, underlying neurochemistry, and clinical correlates of neural systems-level dysfunction in schizophrenia. The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branchs recent efforts have included studies examining pathophysiology and phenotypic heterogeneity in patients carefully studied under both medication-free and treated conditions as well as studies of gene-by-environment interactions relevant to schizophrenia pathogenesis.Under this project, we have advanced comprehensive, multimodal positron emission tomography- and magnetic resonance imaging-based studies of a unique and steadily growing cohort of individuals with schizophrenia who have agreed to be studied under placebo (medication-free) conditions. Though this work is necessarily challenging to conduct, we continue to make progress in data collection, which includes characterization of dopamine-dependent mnemonic and reward-related neural responses, striatal presynaptic dopamine synthetic capacity, and both D1 and D2/3 receptor availability, and neurocognitive functioning. These studies provide the opportunity to better understand illness-related neurobiology in a clinically meaningful context, while accounting for medication effects, and to define contributors to the considerable illness heterogeneity observed in schizophrenia, which may ultimately lead to the development of precision, personalized clinical care.  Our recent work integrating assessments of striatal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), presynaptic dopamine synthesis, and clinical ratings during blinded antipsychotic monotherapy and placebo conditions permitted identification of robust medication effects on striatal rCBF that correspond with aspects of clinical treatment response and remains an active area of research.  We found that variability in both physiological and clinical responses to treatment were predicted by the degree of ventral striatal presynaptic dopaminergic tone present, providing novel insights into potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in therapeutic response and laying the groundwork for studies currently underway utilizing magnetoencephalography in this cohort (Eisenberg et al, 2017).In parallel efforts to further understand the extraordinary variability present across individuals with schizophrenia spectrum illness, we have also employed clinical ratings-based cluster analyses in a large cohort of individuals with schizophrenia.

The long-term goal of this research project is to identify etiologic factors and novel treatments for childhood-onset obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Currently, the primary focus of research attention is OCD which has an unusually abrupt onset and is accompanied by a variety of behavioral, emotional, cognitive and somatic symptoms.  Clinical diagnostic criteria define this group, identified as Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS).  Often, cases of PANS are triggered by a Group A streptococcal infection.  These cases are known by the acronym PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections.) The PANDAS subgroup was initially described at the NIMH in the 1990s and affected children can be distinguished from others with OCD by the abruptness of their symptom onset, as well as by the presence of co-occurring symptoms, such as tics, emotional lability, separation anxiety, concentration difficulties, personality changes, and enuresis or daytime urinary urgency. Five lines of evidence have established PANDAS as a post-infectious autoimmune disorder (Williams and Swedo, Brain Research 2015) and we are now using this knowledge to design new and more effective treatments, as well as exploring biomarkers of disease activity and strategies for prevention of illness.

","Evaluation and Treatment of Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders


","Section on Behavioral Pediatrics, NIMH","
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 1-2% of children and adolescents, causing significant distress and impairments from the unrelenting obsessional thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Approximately 1/4 of children with OCD report an abrupt, dramatic onset of their symptoms.  When these symptoms are accompanied by other behavior problems, cognitive changes and somatic symptoms, the child may qualify for a diagnosis of Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). PANS is characterized by the sudden onset of OCD and/or eating disorder, accompanied by at least two of the following seven comorbidities: 1) Anxiety; 2) Emotional lability and/or depression; 3) Irritability, aggression and/or severely oppositional behaviors; 4) Behavioral (developmental) regression; 5) Deterioration in school performance; 6) Sensory or motor abnormalities; 7) Somatic signs and symptoms, including sleep disturbances, enuresis or urinary frequency and others. (Swedo, Leckman, Rose Pediatr Therapeutics 2:1-8, 2012)For some children with PANS, symptoms appear to arise as a consequence of common childhood infections, including Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections (""strep throat"" and Scarlet fever). Children whose symptoms begin or exacerbate following GAS infections may belong to a subgroup of neuropsychiatric disorders identified by the acronym PANDAS (for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections) (Swedo et al, AJP 1998). Three decades of research has revealed that PANDAS represents a post-streptococcal neuroinflammatory disorder, similar to Sydenham chorea (the neurologic manifestation of acute rheumatic fever).    Five lines of evidence support an etiologic role for GAS infections in PANDAS:  	     1)  Case-control, population-based studies, and school-based observational investigations have shown increased rates of OCD and tic disorders among children with recent GAS infections.	     2)  Prospective, longitudinal evaluations of children with acute-onset OCD reveal symptom exacerbations following GAS infection or exposure     3)  Prompt treatment of GAS infections can ameliorate OCD and other neuropsychiatric symptoms among children newly ill with PANDAS     4)  Prevention of GAS infections reduces neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations (similar to results for rheumatic heart disease or Sydenham chorea)     5)  Repeated GAS infections in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue of mice produce neuroimmune activation via GAS-specific T-cells which enter the brain via the olfactory nerve In PANDAS, symptoms appear to arise when certain rheumatogenic GAS infect genetically vulnerable individuals and provoke the production of antibodies recognizing antigens not only on the GAS cell wall, but also on cells within the human central nervous system.  These cross-reactive antibodies produce neuroinflammation of the basal ganglia, resulting in the abrupt onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms which characterize PANDAS.  An emerging literature supports the classification of PANDAS as a post-infectious (autoantibody-mediated) autoimmune encephalitis; supportive lines of research include:     1) Prospective, longitudinal clinical observations documenting multiple symptom domains, including abnormalities of emotional, behavioral, motor, sensory, somatic and cognitive functions     2)  Abnormalities on clinical laboratory assays, including quantitative immunoglobulins, as well as on paraclinical tests, such as polysomnography or electroencephalography     3) Demonstration of cross-reactive antibodies that recognize both components on the GAS cell wall and human neuronal tissue; titers of these cross-reactive antibodies are higher during acute illness than during convalescence in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as blood of affected individuals     4)  In animal models, passive transfer of the cross-reactive antibodies produces behavioral abnormalities and restricted food intake      5)  Positron emission tomography (PET) studies reveal activated microglia (a sign of neuroinflammation) in the caudate and lentiform nucleus of acutely ill PANDAS patients; these abnormalities resolve with successful immunotherapy     6)  Immune therapies, including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and therapeutic plasmapheresis, have been reported to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms (although a 2016 NIMH/Yale trial of IVIG failed to show superiority of IVIG over placebo for 35 children with PANDAS)To replicate the findings in PANDAS and extend investigations to the larger group of children with PANS, Dr. Swedo is currently leading a nationwide consortium of clinicians and researchers with interest in PANS/PANDAS.  The goals of the collaborative clinical research network are to: (1) improve recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of acute onset neuropsychiatric syndromes, (2) conduct research which improves understanding of etiologic factors, host vulnerability, and disease mechanisms, and c) increase awareness and recognition of PANDAS, PANS, and related disorders in order to improve access to care.  To date, the PANS/PANDAS Clinical Research Consortium has published a guide to the medical evaluation and diagnosis of acute-onset neuropsychiatric disorders (Chang et al, J Child Adol Psychopharmacology, Feb 2015) as well as a set of four papers which provide a comprehensive approach to clinical management (Swedo et al) and include recommendations for use of psychiatric medications and cognitive-behavior therapy (Thienemann et al), as well as treatment with antibiotics (Cooperstock et al) and immunomodulatory therapies (Frankovich et al) (J Child Adol Psychopharmacology Sep 2017, Vol 7, Issue 7, pages 562-606)  Members of the Consortium are collaborating on a number of research projects, including efforts to identify specific antigen-antibody interactions; document neuroinflammation through the use of PET or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); evaluate the impact of the cross-reactive antibodies on the blood-brain barrier and evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutic interventions.  In parallel to these clinical-laboratory investigations, Dr. Swedo has launched a nationwide effort to obtain prospective, longitudinal clinical information, samples and genetic material from children with PANS and their families.  The archived material will be a rich resource for future investigations of disease mechanism, treatment and prevention of acute-onset neuropsychiatric disorders in children.

The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch seeks to generate and test hypotheses about mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction that are relevant to serious mental illnesses and developmental disorders, and to provide information that may inform efforts aimed at improving treatment. Our approach is to define and characterize neurobiological features (brain phenotypes) of cognitive and behavioral disorders using multimodal neuroimaging, and to assess these features in conjunction with genetic, hormonal, and other molecular mechanisms, as well as environmental factors. The overall objective of this work is to use multimodal neuroimaging and neuropsychological batteries to generate a mechanistic account of brain function, development and dysfunction in order to understand mechanisms that translate genetic effects into risk for mental illness. This work is heavily dependent on investigations of healthy control subjects, who harbor both genetic and phenotypic variation relevant to brain circuitry disrupted in neuropsychiatric illness but who are also free of confounding comorbidities, medication treatment, and secondary illness effects. By integrating complementary imaging modalities, this work has been able to provide mechanistic insights into the complex, normative operations of essential cortical-subcortical and fronto-temporal circuits and their neurochemical underpinnings implicated in illness. Furthermore, this deep phenotyping approach permits investigation of multidimensional features (i.e., complex phenotypes) in a manner not otherwise feasible. In addition to these studies, an appreciation for the dynamic nature of these features, both over the course of development and under changing hormonal milieus, has motivated two lines of inquiry, in collaboration with the Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, employing incisive longitudinal designs. First, we have initiated an extensive longitudinal MRI study of children and adolescents, all carefully assessed for pubertal development, aimed at refining our knowledge of developmental trajectories and neural maturation by gene interaction effects on illness-related circuitry. This work will be critical in understanding neurodevelopmental periods vulnerable to illness emergence. Second, we have engaged in a multimodal imaging study assessing the neural effects ovarian steroid hormones in women undergoing a 6-month hormone manipulation protocol involving ovarian suppression and individually replaced estrogen and progesterone. These data may be particularly informative in light of well-established epidemiological and clinical evidence for sex differences in neuropsychiatric illness onsets, presentations, and courses as well as conditions directly linked with hormone fluctuations (e.g., premenstrual dysphoric disorder and post-partum psychosis), as mechanisms underlying these conditions remain unclear.This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001486

","Neuroimaging of Brain Circuits and Molecular Mechanisms in Normal Cognition


","Section on Integrative Neuroimaging, NIMH","
The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to make advances on several fronts in order to delineate the neurochemical, neurogenetic, and neuropsychological contributions to neural systems function and development relevant to mental illness. We have devoted extensive efforts toward data collection for two unprecedented scientific resources: first, a unique multimodal neuroimaging dataset in adults that includes neuropsychological testing, extensive dopaminergic PET imaging as well as functional and structural MRI; and, second, a longitudinal, neurodevelopmental dataset that incorporates structural and functional magnetic resonance-based brain imaging, neuropsychological measures, and, in conjunction with the Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, precise, state-of-the-art endocrinological measurements of pubertal status. These comprehensive ongoing data acquisition efforts have resulted in a growing repository of integrated, multimodal information about the brain, which will permit both novel analyses synthesizing disparate but interrelated indices of neurochemical functioning and discovery of critical genetic and endocrinological factors guiding neurodevelopment. Further progress this year has focused on dissecting genetic, neurochemical and hormonal contributions to cognitive functions, both overall general ability and executive/working memory capacity, which are crucial therapeutic targets in neuropsychiatric illness but also show substantial variation over the lifespan and across individuals even in health.  For instance, in two large collaborative publications, we and colleagues report on genome-wide association studies of general cognitive ability in the largest samples that have yet been assembled for this important phenotype. These studies were able to identify numerous loci with statistically reliable associations to cognitive performance. The work paves the way for fine mapping at significant loci aimed at identifying functional variants and important biological pathways for cognition and provides the foundation for quantification of cumulative polygenic cognitive scoring that may further drive discovery in independent cohorts (Davies et al, 2018; Lam et al, 2018; Savage et al, 2018).  Cognition is dynamic over the lifespan, as our work in neurodevelopmental and aging cohorts has particularly highlighted.  For instance, even within early and middle adulthood among healthy individuals, we have found declining acuity in select cognitive measures, consistent with prior studies; however, biological mechanisms underlying the aging process in the brain remain obscure.  To address this gap in knowledge, we employed magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assay GABA concentrations in the anterior cingulate.  In pursuing this line of inquiry, we have made a number of technological advances, including corrections for frequency drift, which improve signal-to-noise ratios (van der Veen et al, 2017). We found that age-related declines in executive function test performance were mediated by measures of GABA, a result that was not explained by structural atrophic effects.  These data suggest that in line with preclinical work, GABA-related mechanisms may be an important aspect of age-related cognitive deficits (Marenco et al, 2018).  We have continued to further our efforts toward understanding hormonal contributions to cognitive operations as well, having completed a series of studies demonstrating novel interactions between a well-established functional polymorphism in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ovarian steroid hormones consistent with murine models.  These studies employed a rigorous hormone manipulation protocol involving leuprolide acetate induced ovarian suppression and add-back conditions with estrogen and progesterone, and revealed that hippocampal activity during working memory as measured with PET and fMRI showed genotype-related differences only under the estradiol condition (Wei et al, 2018).

The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch seeks to generate and test hypotheses about mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction that are relevant to serious mental illnesses and developmental disorders, and to provide information that may inform efforts aimed at improving treatment. Our approach is to define and characterize neurobiological features (brain phenotypes) of cognitive and behavioral disorders using multimodal neuroimaging, and to assess these features in conjunction with genetic, hormonal, and other molecular mechanisms, as well as environmental factors. The overall objective of this work is to use multimodal neuroimaging and neuropsychological batteries to generate a mechanistic account of brain function, development and dysfunction in order to understand mechanisms that translate genetic effects into risk for mental illness. This work is heavily dependent on investigations of healthy control subjects, who harbor both genetic and phenotypic variation relevant to brain circuitry disrupted in neuropsychiatric illness but who are also free of confounding comorbidities, medication treatment, and secondary illness effects. By integrating complementary imaging modalities, this work has been able to provide mechanistic insights into the complex, normative operations of essential cortical-subcortical and fronto-temporal circuits and their neurochemical underpinnings implicated in illness. Furthermore, this deep phenotyping approach permits investigation of multidimensional features (i.e., complex phenotypes) in a manner not otherwise feasible. In addition to these studies, an appreciation for the dynamic nature of these features, both over the course of development and under changing hormonal milieus, has motivated two lines of inquiry, in collaboration with the Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, employing incisive longitudinal designs. First, we have initiated an extensive longitudinal MRI study of children and adolescents, all carefully assessed for pubertal development, aimed at refining our knowledge of developmental trajectories and neural maturation by gene interaction effects on illness-related circuitry. This work will be critical in understanding neurodevelopmental periods vulnerable to illness emergence. Second, we have engaged in a multimodal imaging study assessing the neural effects ovarian steroid hormones in women undergoing a 6-month hormone manipulation protocol involving ovarian suppression and individually replaced estrogen and progesterone. These data may be particularly informative in light of well-established epidemiological and clinical evidence for sex differences in neuropsychiatric illness onsets, presentations, and courses as well as conditions directly linked with hormone fluctuations (e.g., premenstrual dysphoric disorder and post-partum psychosis), as mechanisms underlying these conditions remain unclear.This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001486

Amnesia is most often seen in patients with damage to the hippocampus, medial thalamus and frontal cortex. Most amnesic patients have a good short-term memory and can create long-term memories for skills and perceptual learning. Amnesia is global in its involvement of all domains of associative knowledge, for both facts (semantic memory) and events (episodic memory), dense in its severity, and anterograde in that the most dramatic effects involve new memories as opposed to old (presurgical or premorbid) ones. This memory impairment has a profound impact on activities of daily life, rendering patients unable to develop the feeling of a coherent, unified life experience. The overall goal of this project is to understand how information about facts and events is stored in the brain and the way in which brain structures work together to subserve memory. The specific objective of this project, accordingly, is to identify the precise brain structures that contribute to rapidly-formed associative memories. In the current review period, we have focused on the association of objects and places.

","Neural Substrates of Stimulus Recognition and Association Memory


","Section on Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, NIMH","
The prevailing model of amnesia holds that it depends on damage to a group of loosely related structures, collectively called the medial temporal lobe (MTL). One influential theory holds that these areas work together as a single functional unit. According to this theory, the structures in the MTL store the memory of specific objects, facts and events. We have developed a competing hypothesis, which holds that different structures within the MTL have specialized functions, and that their collective functions extend beyond those assigned to the MTL by the prevailing model.The ability to learn novel skills throughout our lifetime is known to be mediated by structural changes in the brain. However, the nature of the structural changes and the spatiotemporal dynamics of such changes during the course of learning are unclear. Here, we trained nave subjects in two tasks differing in complexity. The subjects were first trained to criterion in the one-place task, a visuomotor task which required the subject to reach and touch an object on a computer screen to earn a reward.  Next, the subjects were trained in the scenes task, in which they learned to touch a target foreground object placed in an artificial scene composed of multiple geometric elements to earn a reward. The subjects learned several unique scenes concurrently; the identity and location of the target object differed across scenes but was fixed within scenes. We acquired diffusion magnetic resonance images (dMRI) from the subjects across two timepoints using a Bruker 4.7T MRI system. The pre-training scans were acquired before any formal training and the post-training scans were acquired when the subjects reached criterion in the second (scenes) task or failed to reach criterion despite extensive training. Behaviorally, the subjects showed wide individual variability in their ability to acquire the different tasks, with 2 of the 8 subjects failing to learn the one-place task. Interestingly, subjects that required fewer trials to criterion in the one-place task learned faster in the scenes task (rho = - 0.77 p < 0.04). Examination of the spatial topography of changes in dMRI measures based on a median split analysis with group (good/bad learners) and timepoint (Pre/Post) as factors in a linear mixed effects model revealed a significant main effect of group, with the good learners showing higher Fractional Anisotropy (FA) of the right internal capsule, anterior commissure and crus of the fornix. Finally, correlation analysis between the learning profile and changes in dMRI measures revealed: (a) a trend towards a positive correlation between faster learning in the scenes task and global increase in white matter volume; (b) more trials to criterion in the one-place task correlated positively with an increase in FA and a decrease in Radial Diffusivity in the dorsal parieto-occipital white matter. This region is considered part of the fronto-occipito fasciculus, which has been associated with reaching and grasping arm movements. Overall, the pattern of changes in the dMRI measures suggest that prolonged experience in performing the training tasks evokes changes in tissue microstructure consistent with changes in myelination.  Additional subjects are required to draw firm conclusions regarding the relationship between changes in white matter and learning.

The goals of the Section on Neurobiology are  two-fold: (1) To define the function(s)and regulation of the local protein synthetic system present in the axon; and (2) To delineate the mechanism(s) mediating the intracellular trafficking of an RNAs  that  are present in the axon and presynaptic nerve terminal. The central hypothesis of this Section's research program is that the local  function of these RNAs plays an important role in maintaining the  long term  viability of the axon.It is believed that dysfunction of either the normal axonal trafficking of RNA or the intra-axonal protein synthetic system will result in widespread anomalies in brain function and behavior. This hypothesis has direct clinical relevance as there is a growing consensus that dysregulation of local protein synthesis may play an important role in the pathophysiology of multiple neurodevelopmental and/or neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, the local protein synthetic system present in the axon and nerve terminal might serve as heretofore unrecognized foci for the pathobiology of psychiatric disorders. The specific aims of this year's research effort were  three-fold: (1) To initiate investigation of the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the selective transport of mRNA to the axon. In this regard, we will define the regulatory sequences (i.e., zipcodes) present in the 3'untranslated regions of select axonal mRNAs and evaluate the hypothesis that these sequences serve as a nucleation site for the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs); (2) To define the protein constituents of these RNP trafficking complexes; and ( 3) To continue to evaluate the hypothesis that the mRNAs encoding the catecholamine neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes are present and are locally translated into protein in the axon and presynaptic nerve terminal.  These studies will also address, in parallel, the postulate that the synthesis, and release, of the catecholamine neurotransmitters are locally regulated in the distal structural/functional domains of the neuron.

","Subcellular Compartmentalization of Neuronal Gene Expression


","Section on Neurobiology, NIMH","
Although once highly controversial, it is now well- established that there exists a diverse population of mRNAs and non-coding microRNAs in the distal structural/functional domains of the neuron which include the dendrite, axon, and presynaptic nerve terminal. It has also become well- accepted that proteins synthesized from these mRNA templates play a key role in the development and long-term viability of the axon. The findings derived from this new area of investigation have recently been reviewed (Scott et al., 2015).In regard to this past years research activities, members of the Section were committed to the conduct of  two major projects. The progress effected in each of these  projects is summarized, briefly, below: A third project which continued our investigation of axonal microRNA was conducted in the form of an international collaboration and employed only minimal laboratory personnel and resources .Project #1. Regulation of the axonal trafficking of RNA. This past year, the protein constituents of the axonal trafficking granule associated with Cytochrome c-oxidase (Cox IV) mRNA, a messenger that codes for a key component of the oxidative phosphorylation chain, have been tentatively identified by a combination of RNA-affinity purification and mass spectroscopy. This work was conducted in collaboration with Dr. J.A. Kowalak, a staff scientist in the new NIMH/NINDS Mass Spectroscopy Core Facility. Previously the local translation of two of these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs was found to play a key role in the regulation of local energy metabolism, modulating the synthesis of ATP and ultimately the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) (reviewed in Scott et al., 2015; Gale et al., 2018). Dysregulation of the local translation of this mRNA resulted in reductions in the levels of ATP in the axon and an elevation in the production of ROS, two factors which negatively affected the growth and health of the axon.Surprisingly, there are approximately  30-50 different proteins that associate with the RNA sequences that regulate the transport of this mRNA to the axon (i.e., zipcode), a finding that suggests that the zipcode serves as a nucleation site for the formation of an RNA-protein trafficking complex ( see Kar et al., 2017). In addition, the proteins associated with the zipcode, regulating the trafficking of TH mRNA to the axon were identified.  The protein composition of the TH mRNA trafficking complex are now being prepared for publication (Aschrafi et al., Manuscript in preparation).Project # 2. MicroRNAs present in the axonPreviously, we had reported, that in addition to a highly diverse population of mRNAs, that the axon contained over 100 different small, noncoding RNAs One of these miRNAs, miRNA338, was found to coordinately regulate the local expression of several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs that coded for key components of the oxidative phosphorylation chain and regulated local energy metabolism (e,g., Cytochrome-c oxidase IV and ATP synthase mRNAs).. Interestingly, the precursor of the mature, functional form of miRNA 338 was observed to be associated with the organelle, itself. This finding suggested that this precursor miRNA was bound to the mitochondria and served as a reservoir in the activity-dependent activation of the mature miRNA 338 (Vargas et al., 2016). The results of affinity purification and mass spectroscopy experiments indicated that the precursor miRNA338 associated with a large number of proteins that regulated its transport to the axon, as well as its binding to the mitochondria (Vargas et al., 2016). The results of gene ontology analysis indicated that these proteins included mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and axonal motor proteins, as well as a number of well-known RNA-binding proteins. Additionally, Members of our international collaborative research team have found that miRNA338 also regulates the expression of several axon guidance genes that markedly affect the migration and differentiation of cortical neurons during development.Project #3. Local Regulation of Neurotransmitter Synthesis.This year members of the laboratory reported that mRNAs encoding the enzymes that comprise the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway were present in the axon of primary sympathetic neurons and were being actively translated.  (Gervasi et al., 2016; Aschrafi et al., 2017). Importantly the introduction of the mRNA encoding tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, directly into the axon by transfection, markedly increased the synthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters, dopamine and norepinephrine. Stimulation of these sympathetic neurons resulted in significant increases in the release of these two neurotransmitters into the cell culture media (Aschrafi et al., 2017).  Conversely, removal of the zipcode from the 3UTR of the TH mRNA, by gene editing techniques, blocked the transport of the mRNA to the axon and significantly diminished the local synthesis of protein, as well as decreased the axonal levels and release of DA and NE.This year it was also demonstrated that Angiotensin II ( Ang II) augmented the axonal trafficking of TH and DBH mRNAs and enhanced the synthesis of DA and NE.  These effects were abolished by the pretreatment of the neurons with an Angiotensin II antagonist. Surprisingly, the affinity purification of RNP trafficking granules, using the TH zipcode, resulted in the enrichment of the relative abundance of both the TH and DBH mRNAs, suggesting that both of these mRNAs were being transported to the axon together, perhaps in the same RNP granule. Taken together, these results point to a novel mechanism by which Ang II participates in the regulation of the axonal synthesis of NE by modulating the local expression of TH and DBH, two enzymes involved in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway.

MicroRNAs present in the axonPreviously, we had reported, that in addition to a highly diverse population of mRNAs, that the axon contained over 100 different small, noncoding RNAs One of these miRNAs, miRNA338, was found to coordinately regulate the local expression of several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs that coded for key components of the oxidative phosphorylation chain and regulated local energy metabolism (e,g., Cytochrome-c oxidase IV and ATP synthase mRNAs).. Interestingly, the precursor of the mature, functional form of miRNA 338 was observed to be associated with the organelle, itself. This finding suggested that this precursor miRNA was bound to the mitochondria and served as a reservoir in the activity-dependent activation of the mature miRNA 338 (Vargas et al., 2016). The results of affinity purification and mass spectroscopy experiments indicated that the precursor miRNA338 associated with a large number of proteins that regulated its transport to the axon, as well as its binding to the mitochondria (Vargas et al., 2016). The results of gene ontology analysis indicated that these proteins included mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and axonal motor proteins, as well as a number of well-known RNA-binding proteins. Additionally, Members of our international collaborative research team have found that miRNA338 also regulates the expression of several axon guidance genes that markedly affect the migration and differentiation of cortical neurons during development.Project #3. Local Regulation of Neurotransmitter Synthesis.This year members of the laboratory reported that mRNAs encoding the enzymes that comprise the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway were present in the axon of primary sympathetic neurons and were being actively translated.  (Gervasi et al., 2016; Aschrafi et al., 2017). Importantly the introduction of the mRNA encoding tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, directly into the axon by transfection, markedly increased the synthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters, dopamine and norepinephrine. Stimulation of these sympathetic neurons resulted in significant increases in the release of these two neurotransmitters into the cell culture media (Aschrafi et al., 2017).  Conversely, removal of the zipcode from the 3UTR of the TH mRNA, by gene editing techniques, blocked the transport of the mRNA to the axon and significantly diminished the local synthesis of protein, as well as decreased the axonal levels and release of DA and NE.This year it was also demonstrated that Angiotensin II ( Ang II) augmented the axonal trafficking of TH and DBH mRNAs and enhanced the synthesis of DA and NE.  These effects were abolished by the pretreatment of the neurons with an Angiotensin II antagonist. Surprisingly, the affinity purification of RNP trafficking granules, using the TH zipcode, resulted in the enrichment of the relative abundance of both the TH and DBH mRNAs, suggesting that both of these mRNAs were being transported to the axon together, perhaps in the same RNP granule. Taken together, these results point to a novel mechanism by which Ang II participates in the regulation of the axonal synthesis of NE by modulating the local expression of TH and DBH, two enzymes involved in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway.

We are using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine individual differences in neurocognitive function among pediatric anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder.  As a secondary goal of the project, we also are examining the degree to which these neurocognitive measures predict treatment outcome.  Thus, in one aspect of this project, we will test the hypothesis that children and adolescents with mood and anxiety disorders exhibit hyperactivity in the amygdala and ventral prefrontal cortex when confronted with emotionally evocative stimuli.  In a second aspect of this protocol, we will test the hypothesis that levels of hyperactivity before treatment predict a patient's response to treatment.

","fMRI Studies Of Pediatric Mood And Anxiety Disorders


","Section on Development and Affective Neuroscience, NIMH","
This work is conducted under protocol 01-M-0192, NCT00018057.We are using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neurocognitive correlates of pediatric anxiety disorders. Through ongoing collaborative studies, we also have increasingly compared findings in these syndromes with findings in adult anxiety disorders as well as findings in other pediatric mental disorders. This involves a particularly deep interest in the relationships between pediatric anxiety and mood disorders. Through collaborative work, this allows us to examine the similarities and differences between pediatric and adult mood and anxiety disorders. From this vantage point, studies conducted at the NIH as part of this protocol focus most narrowly and deeply on pediatric anxiety disorders. On the other hand, studies conducted with collaborators focus most deeply on adult anxiety disorders and mood or other psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Finally, as the neural correlates of anxiety have been defined increasingly precisely through work in this protocol, we also focus on the manner in which effective treatment changes these neural correlates so that research on novel therapeutics might target such neural correlates. The work performed under this protocol and with the many associated collaborators holds the potential to dramatically impact public health, for various reasons. Mood and anxiety disorder dramatically alter the well-being of children and adolescents. Nevertheless, relatively little work has been conducted on the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions, using methods that allow direct extensions to work in basic neuroscience. fMRI research is vital for work in this area. Such research assesses brain function in children using methods that are directly comparable to the techniques used to study brain function in animal models. Work in this protocol holds the hope of generating insights on pathophysiology in a way that will lead to novel treatment discovery. This hope has increased in recent years for various reasons. For example, work in this protocol and related studies has discovered replicable perturbations that might be targeted by novel treatments, identified through the confluence of findings in animal models and children. In the current protocol, such work has focused on extinction, as it relates to cognitive behavioral therapy, and attention bias, as it relates to both cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive training. As such, this protocol defines a promising pathway for generating treatments that may alter clinical practice. In the past two years, we have published three papers that demonstrates such promise, by targeting aspects of attention, extending research completed in prior years; one randomized controlled trial was published in this area through work with collaborators; this follows from two highly similar randomized controlled trials published in the immediate past year. For work completed at the NIH, we target randomized controlled trials where data also are acquired using data from brain imaging.  In this way, we are directly connecting a measure of brain function to a measure of treatment response, one very important potential breakthrough that is directly relevant to patient care. As such, this protocol demonstrates the potential importance of embedding a clinical trial within a brain imaging study. Finally, in the current year, we devoted considerable efforts to another randomized controlled trial that is heavily recruiting subjects. The central focus of the protocol is on individual differences in neural circuitry function, as they relate to individual differences in behavior and clinical response to treatment. Replicated findings from this project clearly implicate many such deficits in anxiety, moving research on developmental psychopathology into the domain of neuroscience. This shows that individual differences in behavior firmly relate to individual differences in brain function. In the past five years, our focus has been on extending attention-based and fear-conditioning work, in ways that most directly inform therapeutics. As noted above, this has led us to implement novel therapies. We have also devoted considerable time in the protocol to questions on disorder specificity, with a particular focus on comparing mood and anxiety-related problems in the past two years. Prior neuropsychological studies in children as well as in adults note that mood and anxiety disorders are associated with deficits in attention modulation and emotional memory. We have found consistent evidence of such deficits in the current protocol. Moreover, prior imaging studies in healthy adults show that tasks requiring attention modulation or emotional memory engage cortico-limbic brain regions previously implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus. Once again, we also find such evidence in the current set of projects, with multiple, replicated reports of cortico-limbic dysfunction in both pediatric and adult anxiety disorders. This shows that fMRI attention modulation and emotional memory paradigms differentially engage cortico-limbic brain regions in psychiatrically healthy and anxious, impaired subjects. These studies are ongoing in more than 500 subjects. For these subjects, each received neurocognitive examinations, and a subset received fMRI examinations. Each also received standardized assessments of response to treatment. As part of our studies in healthy subjects, we also successfully developed each of the fMRI protocols that will be used in the current project. As noted above, many of our initial hypotheses have been confirmed, and our studies are now moving forward to examine issues of specificity and to consider how our findings might be used to inform advances in treatment. This focus has led to the publication of two notable brain-imaging papers in the past year that compare and contrast findings in anxiety and mood-related psychopathology among youth. During the coming year, we will devote most of our time to build on these two new areas. This includes continuing our recently initiated studies of novel treatments and implementing additional studies of disorder specificity.

 The goal of the current set of studies is to examine the relationship between risk for mood and anxiety disorders and the neural response to emotionally evocative stimuli and situations.  Risk is defined based on one of three indices: exposure to stressful social or medical experiences; extreme temperament during early childhood; parental history of mental illness.  The series of projects in this research program expose children and adolescents varying in one of these three domains to emotionally evocative experiences in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner.  These studies test the hypothesis that risk for mood and anxiety disorders manifests in the neural response to emotionally evocative experiences.  Specifically, risk is hypothesized to manifest in an abnormal response in the amygdala, striatum, and ventral prefrontal cortex.

","fMRI Studies Of Risk For Mood And Anxiety Disorders In Children


","Section on Development and Affective Neuroscience, NIMH","
This work is conducted under protocol 03-M-0186, NCT00060775.In this project, our group is examining biological aspects of risk for mood and anxiety disorders in children. Such work has major public impact. By identifying biological risks in children, information on novel treatments and preventative interventions will emerge. Given the understanding of most chronic mental illnesses as developmental disorders, such information holds the hope of dramatically influencing the mental well-being of many individuals. This project encompasses work examining the degree to which neurocognitive profiles vary among children and adolescents stratified with respect to personal and family history of mood and anxiety disorders. For these studies, personal history is defined based on early-childhood temperament. In a second protocol, we are acquiring fMRI data from a subset of these subjects. We have expanded our efforts in these protocols to encompass studies in juveniles across the full span of childhood and adolescence. Thus, one set of studies is based among young adults who have been prospectively followed for more than two decades. A second set of studies is based in school-aged children who are now approaching adolescence. In both sets of studies, as well as the larger series of studies in this project, considerable progress continues to be made.  A third set of studies has initiated data collection during infancy.  Across the three sets of cohorts, this project seeks to achieve a lifespan developmental perspective throughout the entire period of maturation.  Studies on temperamental risk continue to dominate activities during the past year, as they had in the few years immediately prior. Thus, in this past year, studies on temperament occupy approximately 90% of all resources devoted to research on risk. During the past two years, we spent most of our efforts on collecting data in a childhood cohort, where the subjects are now approximately 16 years old. Both last year and this year, our work in this cohort continues to consistently replicate findings in across cohorts. We demonstrate the persistent influence of temperament on risk into for psychopathology. In this past year, we have focused most of our efforts on identifying neurocognitive factors that isolate subsets of children with particular temperaments who face the greatest risk for psychopathology. This has generated a steady stream of brain-imaging papers in both of these cohorts. Finally, other questions relate to the identification of factors that differentiate among children who are at high risk yet remain resilient from those who are at risk but manifest problems. Work in this project over the next few years is designed to address these questions. Problems with anxiety tend to run in families. Thus, anxiety often occurs among children born to parents with anxiety disorders as well as in children born to parents with major depressive disorder (MDD). In adults, MDD involves dysfunction in prefrontal brain regions that regulate attention to emotional stimuli. These abnormalities: i) have been found primarily in adults with specific familial forms of MDD, ii) persist after recovery from MDD, and iii) relate to anxiety. In adults, some data suggest that anxiety disorders are also associated with prefrontal dysfunction. However, findings in anxiety appear most strongly related to attention, whereas findings in MDD appear most strongly related to memory. This has stimulated attempts to dissociate factors in children associated with risk for anxiety as opposed to MDD. This protocol is attempting to dissociate these aspects of risk, through behavioral and fMRI studies of emotion regulation in high and low-risk adolescents. In general, research in this area continues to occupy a shrinking amount of resources in our group. Finally, our most in-depth studies focus on the temperament of ""behavioral inhibition."" This work is made possible through our strong collaborative relationship with Dr. Nathan Fox at the University of Maryland. Our studies in this area continued to grow and expand this year, as they had done in the immediately prior years. Dr. Fox has followed cohorts of approximately 600 infants as they passed though childhood. These children have received repeated assessments of their temperament. Temperament classifications in the sample during infancy and early childhood have been shown to predict behavior later in life. We have also completed a series of investigations in this sample. Results from these studies support the conclusions generated in other research within our group. Namely, this work establishes the presence of strong, consistent associations between the presence of and risk factors for mental illness in children and the presence of perturbed brain function.In the past year, our group continued to have significant success in charting relationships between temperament and brain function. We continue to publish widely in this area, having published more than 20 papers in this area during the past year, and we have acquired data from many subjects during the past 12 months. During the next year, we plan to continue to report results from completed research. This includes reports on subjects who now are in their late-20's, examining the manner in which early temperament relates to later brain function and psychopathology, expressed in early adulthood. Finally, we have completed studies in the younger cohort, with assessments when the subjects were approximately 15 years old, and we are initiating assessments when the subjects will be 16 years old. This led to many papers in various stages of completion. This includes reports from studies both in late adolescents and in pre-adolescent children. Most importantly, we are in the midst of preparing papers that will report data from imaging studies in this younger cohort of pre-adolescents. Overall, the results from these studies show that the seeds of temperament continue to be expressed throughout development. Behaviorally, these seeds are expressed in measures of task performance and signs of psychopathology. From a brain-function perspective, these seeds are expressed in measures of electrophysiology and fMRI. Moreover, these measures of brain function mediate and moderate the relationships between temperament and psychopathology. As such, the studies provide important information on understanding risk for psychopathology.

 The goal of the current set of studies is to examine the relationship between risk for mood and anxiety disorders and the neural response to emotionally evocative stimuli and situations.  Risk is defined based on one of three indices: exposure to stressful social or medical experiences; extreme temperament during early childhood; parental history of mental illness.  The series of projects in this research program expose children and adolescents varying in one of these three domains to emotionally evocative experiences in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner.  These studies test the hypothesis that risk for mood and anxiety disorders manifests in the neural response to emotionally evocative experiences.  Specifically, risk is hypothesized to manifest in an abnormal response in the amygdala, striatum, and ventral prefrontal cortex.

This work is conducted under protocol 03-M-0186, NCT00060775.In this project, our group is examining biological aspects of risk for mood and anxiety disorders in children. Such work has major public impact. By identifying biological risks in children, information on novel treatments and preventative interventions will emerge. Given the understanding of most chronic mental illnesses as developmental disorders, such information holds the hope of dramatically influencing the mental well-being of many individuals. This project encompasses work examining the degree to which neurocognitive profiles vary among children and adolescents stratified with respect to personal and family history of mood and anxiety disorders. For these studies, personal history is defined based on early-childhood temperament. In a second protocol, we are acquiring fMRI data from a subset of these subjects. We have expanded our efforts in these protocols to encompass studies in juveniles across the full span of childhood and adolescence. Thus, one set of studies is based among young adults who have been prospectively followed for more than two decades. A second set of studies is based in school-aged children who are now approaching adolescence. In both sets of studies, as well as the larger series of studies in this project, considerable progress continues to be made.  A third set of studies has initiated data collection during infancy.  Across the three sets of cohorts, this project seeks to achieve a lifespan developmental perspective throughout the entire period of maturation.  Studies on temperamental risk continue to dominate activities during the past year, as they had in the few years immediately prior. Thus, in this past year, studies on temperament occupy approximately 90% of all resources devoted to research on risk. During the past two years, we spent most of our efforts on collecting data in a childhood cohort, where the subjects are now approximately 16 years old. Both last year and this year, our work in this cohort continues to consistently replicate findings in across cohorts. We demonstrate the persistent influence of temperament on risk into for psychopathology. In this past year, we have focused most of our efforts on identifying neurocognitive factors that isolate subsets of children with particular temperaments who face the greatest risk for psychopathology. This has generated a steady stream of brain-imaging papers in both of these cohorts. Finally, other questions relate to the identification of factors that differentiate among children who are at high risk yet remain resilient from those who are at risk but manifest problems. Work in this project over the next few years is designed to address these questions. Problems with anxiety tend to run in families. Thus, anxiety often occurs among children born to parents with anxiety disorders as well as in children born to parents with major depressive disorder (MDD). In adults, MDD involves dysfunction in prefrontal brain regions that regulate attention to emotional stimuli. These abnormalities: i) have been found primarily in adults with specific familial forms of MDD, ii) persist after recovery from MDD, and iii) relate to anxiety. In adults, some data suggest that anxiety disorders are also associated with prefrontal dysfunction. However, findings in anxiety appear most strongly related to attention, whereas findings in MDD appear most strongly related to memory. This has stimulated attempts to dissociate factors in children associated with risk for anxiety as opposed to MDD. This protocol is attempting to dissociate these aspects of risk, through behavioral and fMRI studies of emotion regulation in high and low-risk adolescents. In general, research in this area continues to occupy a shrinking amount of resources in our group. Finally, our most in-depth studies focus on the temperament of ""behavioral inhibition."" This work is made possible through our strong collaborative relationship with Dr. Nathan Fox at the University of Maryland. Our studies in this area continued to grow and expand this year, as they had done in the immediately prior years. Dr. Fox has followed cohorts of approximately 600 infants as they passed though childhood. These children have received repeated assessments of their temperament. Temperament classifications in the sample during infancy and early childhood have been shown to predict behavior later in life. We have also completed a series of investigations in this sample. Results from these studies support the conclusions generated in other research within our group. Namely, this work establishes the presence of strong, consistent associations between the presence of and risk factors for mental illness in children and the presence of perturbed brain function.In the past year, our group continued to have significant success in charting relationships between temperament and brain function. We continue to publish widely in this area, having published more than 20 papers in this area during the past year, and we have acquired data from many subjects during the past 12 months. During the next year, we plan to continue to report results from completed research. This includes reports on subjects who now are in their late-20's, examining the manner in which early temperament relates to later brain function and psychopathology, expressed in early adulthood. Finally, we have completed studies in the younger cohort, with assessments when the subjects were approximately 15 years old, and we are initiating assessments when the subjects will be 16 years old.

The overall goal of the Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM) is to better understand and more efficiently extract and use the signal from MR images and fMRI time series to address neuroscience and clinical questions. Recently we have been focusing advancing on precise yet robust methods to separate non-neuronal from neuronal signal changes, and have been increasing our effort in three other areas: Layer-specific fMRI mapping of activation, behavioral correlates of fMRI connectivity, and methods to derive ongoing neuronal activity from time series connectivity. We are also just beginning our work in setting up an EEG-fMRI pipeline, more time efficient methods to derive highly precise blood volume change information, and the use of naturalistic stimuli to drive brain activity in a way that optimally stratifies differences in individuals.  In addition, we have set up several productive collaborations that allow us to contribute to understanding the underpinnings of BOLD contrast, perform blind derivation individual events from time series, and more precisely identify ongoing tasks while they are being performed in the scanner. The specific goals mentioned above could be broken down into two major avenues: 1. High resolution layer specific fMRI to bridge the gap between systems level neuroscience and cellular level neuroscience - allowing us to network inform network models by incorporating directionality and causality based on layer activation location. 2. Dynamic connectivity and activity assessment during ongoing tasks. Here we are developing methods to extract ongoing neuronal activity and to compare this activity across individuals.

","Functional MRI Method Development


","Section on Functional Imaging Methods, NIMH","
Protocol number 93-M-0170, NCT00001360The Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM) has advanced functional MRI (fMRI) methodology through development of novel paradigms, acquisition methods, and processing methods  Our work over the past year can be grouped into the following categories: Layer-Specific fMRI, Dynamic Functional Connectivity and Activity, Naturalistic tasks, Individual Differences, Simultaneous EEG-fMRI, Underpinnings of resting state fMRI signal changes, and Pulse Sequence Development and Optimization. Layer-specific fMRI methods: We continued to develop acquisition fMRI methods that can measure brain activity with ultra-high resolution, aiming to distinguish activity across cortical layers and columns. The novel parameter space explored since October 2017 includes the following: A study comparing the capabilities of layer-fMRI at ultra-high field strengths of 9.4T compared to 7T has been completed. We could investigate layer-dependent signal features across different cortical columns in M1 in a participant-specific surface-based signal evaluation scheme to identify individual finger representations in primary motor cortex. We could investigate the layer-dependent activity in the primary sensory system distinguishing feed-forward input during finger touching vs. expectation feed-back input during a mental prediction task. We developed a new software suite in C++, LAYNII for more streamlined analysis of layer fMRI. We could translate the layer-fMRI technology to be applicable in cognitive brain areas including the dorso-lateral-prefrontal cortex and applied it with a working memory task. Dynamic Functional Connectivity and Activity: Understanding how FC states populate such high dimensional space is important, as it will help us address questions such as whether FC dynamics should be modeled as a continuous or discrete space, what mathematical tools are best suited to group FC states and what aspects of FC spatial distributions are affected by mental conditions. In this project we are exploring the use of different linear (e.g., PCA) and non-linear (e.g., ISOMAP, Spectral Embedding, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques to compute low (e.g., 2 or 3) dimensional embeddings of FC states during both task and rest. We also explore how these embeddings can help us make better informed decisions regarding how to compare and group FC states.Naturalistic Tasks:In the last year, we have continued to make advances in collecting and analyzing fMRI data while subjects are engaged in naturalistic paradigms (i.e., watching a movie or listening to story). We are exploring the possibility of using such tasks as brain stress tests to draw out individual variation as it relates to intrinsic personality and cognitive traits. Specific accomplishments in the past year include the following: a) We have demonstrated that healthy individuals who score higher on a measure of trait-level paranoia have distinct brain and behavioral responses to an ambiguous social narrative. This serves as proof-of-concept that an identical stimulus can evoke different neural and behavioral reactions across individuals, and that these differences stem from an intrinsic trait that is relevant to psychiatric illness. b) Using a large scale, publicly available data set, we have explored a large space of potential approaches to analyzing naturalistic fMRI data. We found that inter-subject correlation, which takes advantage of the time-locked nature of the stimulus across subjects but does not make any assumptions about the structure of the task, is more sensitive to phenotypic differences across subjects than either traditional stimulus-derived regressors or functional connectivity. We are currently confirming this result using other data sets and exploring additional analyses using regions of interest delineated by inter-subject correlation. c) We have begun developing and piloting new and innovative experimental paradigms that combine naturalistic tasks during fMRI with detailed behavioral and phenotypic assessment. In the next year we expect to launch a full-scale data collection effort on both healthy controls and psychiatric patients.Individual Differences:In the last year, we have continued to make progress using functional brain connectivity to characterize individuals and predict behavior at the single-subject level. Specifically, we have made the following advances: a) We have shown that functional connectivity profiles extracted from fMRI data acquired during a task, as opposed to during the resting state, yields more accurate predictions of a sophisticated cognitive trait (fluid intelligence). We are currently characterizing the differences in predictions derived from different tasks, and extending these results to additional behaviors. b) We have shown that relative differences in functional connectivity across subjects are more informative than absolute differences. We have demonstrated this via a comparison of various data processing methods that emphasize either relative or absolute changes, with the aim of optimizing a pipeline for behavioral prediction from functional connectivity data. A manuscript on these results is in preparation.Simultaneous EEG-fMRI:While fMRI has set the standard for spatial resolution in millimeters (and sub-millimeter in 7-Tesla), it sacrifices precision in temporal resolution  most often averaging over the span of 12 seconds. EEG provides excellent temporal resolution in milliseconds, and also represents actual neuronal firings/activity. With technological advances in the past ten years, multiple manufacturers have developed simultaneous EEG-fMRI systems, capable of recording both modalities (EEG, fMRI) at the same time. This technological advance, also paired with the increase in number of EEG sensors, provides the possibility of more sophisticated methods of combining data with high temporal and high spatial information. We have begun to identify how simultaneous EEG-fMRI changes the structure of signal and noise in the fMRI data. To do this, we have combined simultaneous data with our methods developed for multi-echo fMRI denoising (particularly those with independent component analysis; ICA) to identify if the sensors themselves change the detection of signal and noise components, and whether the EEG can similarly be used as an additional variable in the ICA to aid in denoising of the multi-echo fMRI data. Underpinnings of resting state fMRI signal changes:We have started analyzing data as co-investigators on a BRAIn grant with Elizabeth Hillman of Columbia University. Dr. Hillman has been using wide field optical mapping in awake, behaving mice to acquire GCaMP (a Calcium-based neural activity measure) and hemodynamic signals across much of the rostral cortex. With these data, we can apply and attempt to validate the dynamic functional connectivity metrics that are often used with fMRI.Pulse Sequence Development and Optimization: Our work developing and utilizing ME fMRI continues. In collaboration with Dr. Caballero-Gaudes, we are working on the detection of individual BOLD events with no information about the task timing or location. Preliminary tests show that the algorithm can reliably detect BOLD events associated with each individual trial in a manner similar to traditional GLM methods, yet without any information on paradigm timing. This new method has important applications including: uncovering hemodynamic events driving dynamic resting functional connectivity, and detecting inter-ictal events in epilepsy patients without the need for concurrent EEG recordings.

The goal of our work is to understand how adult neurogenesis contributes to the function of the regions in which it occurs, particularly the hippocampus. Most neurons in the mammalian brain are generated before birth and are never added to or replaced after this time. However, specific populations of neurons in several brain regions continue to be generated throughout adulthood. By determining how environmental factors and experiences affect the production of new neurons, how neurons born during development and during adulthood differ, and what types of behavioral changes occur when neurogenesis is inhibited or enhanced, we hope to better understand the normal function of new neurons as well as their role in pathological conditions including mood disorders.

","Neurogenesis in the Adult Brain


","Section on Neuroplasticity, NIMH","
This project focuses on the interactions between experience and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal region of the brain. We are interested in understanding how experiences, including positive and stressful experiences, regulate adult neurogenesis and how the new neurons alter responses in these situations. We study the regulation and function of adult neurogenesis in rats and mice, which show continued production of new neurons throughout adulthood similar to that in primates, including humans. We have previously found that specifically inhibiting adult neurogenesis in mice increases their response to stress, leading to enhanced caution, or anxiety-like behavior, in unpredictable threat situation. During the past year, we have asked whether adult neurogenesis affects behavior under positive, or rewarding, conditions as well as stressful, threatening conditions. To do this, we used transgenic rat and mouse lines that we developed that allow us to stop neurogenesis with no side effects by feeding the animals an antiviral drug. We trained these animals lacking adult neurogenesis, and sibling control animals with normal adult neurogenesis, to lever press for food rewards. We found that loss of new neurons had no effect on the animals ability to learn to lever press for rewards or on their preference for one reward over another. However, when animals had to work progressively harder for each successive reward, the animals lacking adult neurogenesis gave up sooner. And when animals could eat plain chow or work for rewarding food, the animals without new neurons earned fewer rewards. These effects were seen in both mice and rats. However, these effects were not observed when a highly preferred food reward was used in testing. Taken together, these findings suggest that adult neurogenesis does affect behavior under non-stressful, rewarding conditions. Specifically, the new neurons appear to enhance motivation to work for weak, but not strong, rewards. This phenotype appears similar to a human condition described as behavioral apathy.

In the 1990s, clinicians began diagnosing youth with severe irritability and symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with bipolar disorder (BD), although they do not exhibit manic episodes. In 2003 we defined criteria for such chronically, severely irritable children (severe mood dysregulation, SMD). Our original goal was to identify how SMD is similar to, or different from, BD in symptoms, illness course, family history, treatment response, and brain mechanisms. We found that youth with severe irritability are not at increased risk for BD with age, but instead are at risk for unipolar depression and anxiety disorders. We also demonstrated genetic associations among irritability, anxiety, and unipolar depression, and familial associations between irritability and depression/anxiety, but not with bipolar disorder. These results indicate that youth with severe irritability, but without distinct manic episodes, should not receive the diagnosis of BD. These results help to ensure that youth with severe irritability will be diagnosed appropriately and receive the treatment most likely to alleviate their symptoms while incurring the least possible side-effects. SMD was the prototype for the new DSM-5 diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder with dysphoria(DMDD).The primary goal of this study (ZIA MH002786-17) is to identify the pathophysiology of severe irritability in youth to foster the development of novel treatments for this common and impairing symptom. We then undertake clinical trials to test these novel interventions. Severe pediatric irritability a very common problem, yet relatively little brain-based research has been devoted to it. Studies on the accompanying symptoms and course of irritability, as well as brain mechanisms, are timely and important. Irritability is a dimension present across the population, so its study fits well into the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative. Further, also consistent with RDoC, irritability is one of the most important transdiagnostic symptoms in youth.  Therefore, many of our studies include not only youth with severe irritability (i.e., those with DMDD) and healthy subjects, but also those with anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), because youth with these illnesses often exhibit significant irritability.This work has major public health impact. If youth with SMD have a form of unipolar depression and/or anxiety, along with ADHD, then treatment with antidepressants and stimulants is indicated. However, in BD, this would be relatively contraindicated, and treatment would be with atypical antipsychotic and/or mood stabilizing medication, which have high side-effect burdens. This year we completed an ongoing trial of stimulant plus antidepressant in SMD. Also, we are developing two novel psychosocial interventions for DMDD. One randomized controlled trial,  targets DMDD youths tendency to see ambiguous faces as hostile. The other, now enrolling patients, involves testing a cognitive behavioral treatment targeting neural mechanisms mediating irritability, including deficits in instrumental conditioning and the ability to tolerate frustration. Both trials incorporate neuroimaging to identify brain mechanisms mediating response and guide future treatment development. Developing novel non-pharmacologic treatments for DMDD in children is important because of the imperative to minimize exposure of the developing brain to medication wherever possible. In sum, the goals are to 1)adopt a dimensional, trans-diagnostic perspective to identify the pathophysiology of severe irritability in youth, 2) use this knowledge as the basis for novel interventions for irritability; and 4)test these novel pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for severe irritability in youth. This work was conducted under protocols 02-M-0021(NCT00025935),00-M-0198(NCT00006177), 09-M-0034(NCT00794040),and 15-M-0182(NCT02531893).

","The Pathophysiology and Treatment of Children with Severe Irritability ZIA MH002786-17


","Section on Mood Dysregulation and Neuroscience, NIMH","
Given concerns about the appropriate diagnosis for children with chronic, severe irritability, we defined severe mood dysregulation(SMD)to capture youth with extremely severe irritability and symptoms of hyperarousal. Our SMD phenotype formed the basis for the new pediatric diagnosis of mood dysregulation disorder with dysphoria(DMDD)in DSM-5. Since the inception of this project (ZIA MH002786-17), approximately 375 highly irritable (i.e., those with SMD, DMDD, or sub-threshold DMDD) have been recruited into the project, along with more than 100 youth with ADHD. (Many DMDD patients also have ADHD, and youth with ADHD tend to have less irritability than those with DMDD but more than healthy youth, making them an appropriate comparison group for your work.) Approximately 40 new patients were recruited this year. Youth with DMDD suffer severe psychiatric impairment, in terms of medications received, psychiatric hospitalizations, and standardized measures of function. As noted above, irritability is one of the most common psychiatric symptoms in children, but there has been little brain-based research devoted to it, and there are few evidence-based treatments. This year, we published a translational mechanistic model of irritability suggesting that core deficits in pediatric irritability include aberrant responses to frustration, aberrant approach responses to threat, and deficits in instrumental learning that prevent adaptation to changes in environmental contingencies. Irritability is particularly well-suited for the transdiagnostic, translational approach of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Our work involves examining irritability characterized as a continuous variable, in DMDD and other groups with irritability, including youth with anxiety disorders or ADHD. Our neuroimaging work includes the use of frustrating tasks, since a hallmark of irritability is difficulty tolerating frustration. Previously, we demonstrated behavioral and neural differences between irritable and non-irritable youth during a frustrating attentional task. We improved that paradigm and obtained fMRI data from approximately 200 youth with DMDD, ADHD, and/or anxiety disorders, as well as healthy youth. In a manuscript recently accepted for publication, we found that irritability is associated with increased prefrontal and striatal engagement when youth attempt an attention orienting task after receiving frustrating feedback. Since prefrontal engagement is important in emotion regulation, one interpretation of this finding is that prefrontal emotion regulation mechanisms are less efficient in irritable vs. non-irritable youth. Alternatively, in irritable youth, increased prefrontal engagement may be required after frustration to down-regulate exaggerated subcortical limbic responses e.g., in the striatum. These effects of irritability are present even when ADHD and anxiety are taken into account.We have piloted two additional frustration tasks. The second frustration task differs from the first in the timing of frustration (short blocks of frustration, interspersed randomly with non-frustrating blocks, vs. a long block of non-frustration followed by a long bout of frustration) and in the cognitive task (attention orienting vs. cognitive flexibility). This second task allows us to test whether, across different task timing and cognitive tasks, increased irritability is associated with increased prefrontal engagement after frustration. We are now analyzing data from 80 healthy youth or those with DMDD, anxiety, or ADHD. Our third frustration task allows us to determine if irritability is associated with instrumental learning deficits at baseline and after frustration. Instrumental learning is the process by which people learn which of their behaviors will be rewarded. Deficits in such learning could lead to increased frustration in irritable youth. We successfully piloted this task outside the scanner and are now acquiring imaging data. Children typically present with multiple symptoms and diagnoses. It is important to identify pathophysiological mechanisms specific to different symptoms, and how the neural mechanisms mediating different symptoms interact. Such research furthers efforts toward personalized medicine. We are interested in neural mechanisms that differentiate anxiety and irritability, given cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between these traits and possible shared circuitry mediating them. Both irritable and anxious youth have an attention bias toward threatening faces. Therefore, we scanned approximately 200 children with a range of common symptoms, including anxiety, irritability, and ADHD, while they completed an attention bias task. In a manuscript published this year, we used cutting-edge statistical techniques to dissociate neural activation associated with parent- or child-reported irritability or anxiety. We found that irritability is associated with increased amygdala, striatal, and prefrontal engagement when subjects were asked to attend away from threat. In contrast, anxiety was associated with normal neural activity but abnormal connectivity between prefrontal and limbic regions. A major focus of our work is treatment. We completed our double-blind trial designed to ascertain whether citalopram (a serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant that is effective in the treatment of pediatric anxiety) plus stimulant is more effective than placebo plus stimulant in the treatment of severe irritability. In a sample of 49 youth, we demonstrated that indeed, stimulant plus citalopram is more effective in reducing irritability than is stimulant plus placebo. These data are currently being prepared for publication. Stimulant and SRI treatment tend to have fewer side-effects than atypical antipsychotic treatment, which is used frequently in youth with severe irritability. Therefore, this work has considerable public health importance. We recently developed and are testing two novel psychosocial approaches to treating irritability. The first involves computer-based training designed to shift a subject's perception of ambiguous faces from angry toward happy. In work published last year, we found that youth with DMDD tend to judge ambiguous faces as angry rather than happy; that we can change this judgment with computer-based training; and that this is associated with decreased irritability. This was an open trial, without a control condition. In 2016, we began a controlled trial of this new Interpretation Bias Treatment, along with brain imaging before and after training.  Our target enrollment is 40 youth, and 35 have completed the protocol. Therefore, we anticipate finishing this trial soon and preparing the results for publication. This year, we completed and published an open pilot study of a manual-based cognitive behavioral treatment targeting irritability. This treatment has a strong emphasis on behavioral techniques i.e., exposing the child to tolerable, but frustrating situations, to improve the child's ability to tolerate such situations. The treatment is modelled on exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, and draws heavily on our neuroscience-based model of irritability, including irritable children's hypothesized deficits in the process and content of instrumental learning, and their aberrant responses to frustration. We designed and are now enrolling subjects for a multiple baseline design study of this new treatment. Such a design allows for more structured piloting whose results can be subjected to statistical analysis. Imaging on the first frustration paradigm and the threat paradigms, described above, will be conducted pre and post treatment. Outcome variables will include not only clinical ratings, but also real-time parent and child reports of temper outbursts using ecological momentary assessment.

We completed our double-blind trial designed to ascertain whether citalopram (a serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant that is effective in the treatment of pediatric anxiety) plus stimulant is more effective than placebo plus stimulant in the treatment of severe irritability. In a sample of 49 youth, we demonstrated that indeed, stimulant plus citalopram is more effective in reducing irritability than is stimulant plus placebo. These data are currently being prepared for publication. Stimulant and SRI treatment tend to have fewer side-effects than atypical antipsychotic treatment, which is used frequently in youth with severe irritability. Therefore, this work has considerable public health importance. We recently developed and are testing two novel psychosocial approaches to treating irritability. The first involves computer-based training designed to shift a subject's perception of ambiguous faces from angry toward happy. In work published last year, we found that youth with DMDD tend to judge ambiguous faces as angry rather than happy; that we can change this judgment with computer-based training; and that this is associated with decreased irritability. This was an open trial, without a control condition. In 2016, we began a controlled trial of this new Interpretation Bias Treatment, along with brain imaging before and after training.  Our target enrollment is 40 youth, and 35 have completed the protocol. Therefore, we anticipate finishing this trial soon and preparing the results for publication. This year, we completed and published an open pilot study of a manual-based cognitive behavioral treatment targeting irritability. This treatment has a strong emphasis on behavioral techniques i.e., exposing the child to tolerable, but frustrating situations, to improve the child's ability to tolerate such situations. The treatment is modelled on exposure therapy for anxiety disorders, and draws heavily on our neuroscience-based model of irritability, including irritable children's hypothesized deficits in the process and content of instrumental learning, and their aberrant responses to frustration. We designed and are now enrolling subjects for a multiple baseline design study of this new treatment. Such a design allows for more structured piloting whose results can be subjected to statistical analysis. Imaging on the first frustration paradigm and the threat paradigms, described above, will be conducted pre and post treatment. Outcome variables will include not only clinical ratings, but also real-time parent and child reports of temper outbursts using ecological momentary assessment.

Our laboratory's overall aim is to develop new radiotracers for use in living human subjects with the imaging technique of positron emission tomography (PET) to provide biomolecular insights into mental disorders and their treatments. A major premise in modern psychiatry is that dysfunctions in brain proteins underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders. Each new radiotracer that we develop is designed to report on the status of a specific biochemical process (e.g., neurotransmission) or a specific protein target (e.g., enzyme, neurotransmitter receptor, transporter, or plaque) within the living human brain, and in some cases on how this protein may be acted upon or affected by established or experimental drugs.The development of novel PET radiotracers is an ambitious and challenging field of research, requiring immense basic effort at the levels of medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and rapid radiochemistry with very short-lived radioisotopes (i.e., carbon-11 and fluorine-18 that have half-lives of 20 and 110 min, respectively). These efforts are augmented with important contributions from other imaging sciences (e.g., biology, medicine, physics, biomathematical modeling). In our laboratory, the PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Section (PRSS) of the Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB), this effort is approached through research in organic and medicinal chemistry, radiochemistry, and radio-bioanalytical techniques. Our research program closely interacts with the Section on PET Neuroimaging Sciences in our Branch for effective novel radiotracer evaluation in animals and human subjects. We also collaborate within NIMH and NIH, and with national and international academic centers, and with Pharma. The new information to be gained on the living brain through these efforts on new radiotracer development is inaccessible by other means: the application of radiotracers with PET provides unique windows into specific aspects of the normal and dysfunctional molecular workings of the living human brain.The short half-lives of carbon-11 and fluorine-18 demand methodological advances for their efficient incorporation into new radiotracers at specific molecular sites. An important part of our laboratory's remit is therefore to develop and apply such methodology in order to provide a strong foundation for PET radiotracer development. Moreover, the short half-lives of carbon-11 and fluorine-18 demand radiotracers to be produced rapidly for each PET imaging experiment performed in an animal or human subject. Our Section produces a wide range of such radiotracers on a regular basis. We are also engaged in studies of radiotracer metabolism to deepen our understanding of radiotracer behavior and to provide rigorous radiotracer evaluation. Such studies also facilitate new radiotracer design.Ultimately, developments in this field may have an impact on the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of disorders (e.g., anxiety, autism, depression, Fragile X syndrome, drug addiction, stroke, traumatic brain injury and dementia).

","PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences


","Section on PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences, NIMH","
The Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB) aims to exploit positron emission tomography (PET) as a radiotracer imaging technique for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, depression, addiction, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Fundamental to this mission is the development of novel radioactive probes (radiotracers) that can be used with PET to measure changes in low level proteins in the brains of living human subjects where these proteins are suspected to have critical involvement in the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. Such proteins include some neuroreceptors, transporters, enzymes, and plaques. PET is uniquely powerful and sensitive when coupled with the use of biochemically-specific PET radiotracers. The chemical development of new radiotracers is the key to exploiting the full potential of PET in neuropsychiatric research. However, a successful PET radiotracer must satisfy a wide range of difficult-to-satisfy chemical, biochemical, and pharmacological criteria. Consequently, PET radiotracer development is highly challenging. In fact, our research has some parallels with drug discovery in that it entails high effort and heavy risk but can reap rich biomedical rewards. As of now, the number of potentially interesting PET imaging targets (brain proteins) far exceeds the range of currently available and useful radiotracers.Within MIB, the PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Section (PRSS) places a concerted effort on all chemical and radiochemical aspects of PET radiotracer discovery. Our laboratories are equipped for medicinal chemistry and automated radiochemistry with positron-emitting carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20 min) and fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 110 min). These two very short-lived radioisotopes are available to us daily from the adjacent cyclotrons of the NIH Clinical Center (Chief: Dr. P. Herscovitch). Our Section interacts seamlessly with the Section on PET Neuroimaging Sciences in our Branch (Chief: Dr. R.B. Innis) for early evaluation of potential radiotracers in biological models and in animals. Subsequent PET research in human subjects is also performed in collaboration with the Imaging Section under Food and Drug Administration oversight through 'exploratory' or 'full' Investigational New Drug applications. In the period covered by this report, we worked on developing and producing PET radiotracers for several protein targets. These include translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO); the NR2B sub-site of the NMDA receptor, serotonin subtype 1B (5-HT1B)receptors, dopamine subtype-3 (D3)receptors; and several enzymes (COX-1, COX-2, PDE1 and PDE4 subtypes, and OGA).One radiotracer that we earlier developed for TSPO imaging (C-11PBR28) has been applied by many imaging centers to investigate brain inflammatory conditions (i.e., neuroinflammation) in response to various neurological insults (e.g., stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration). An unexpected finding is that healthy human subjects, because of a genetic difference, carry either one or both of two distinct forms of TSPO and that these interact differently with C-11PBR28, complicating the analysis of PET studies. Consequently, we sought to develop genetically-insensitive TSPO radiotracers. We explored new chemotypes with potential to provide superior PET radiotracers for TSPO. One of our new radiotracers, C-11ER176, appeared promising for avoiding genotype sensitivity based on our evaluation in animals and in human tissue in vitro. In addition, while C-11ER176 does not show the expected genotype insensitivity in living humans, it does turn out to be one of the highest performing TSPO radiotracers yet known, and especially is able to quantify TSPO in all subjects of identified genotype. We and other imaging centers now plan to use this radiotracer for clinical studies in human subjects. C-11ER76 production has been established in a new cGMP facility for this purpose. We are also developing longer-lived and therefore more broadly useful F-18 labeled versions of this radiotracer. We are now developing radiotracers for other targets relevant to the study of neuroinflammation, such as the cyclooxygenase (COX) subtype 1 and subtype 2 enzymes. Very promising C-11 labeled radiotracers have been identified, and two of these are now being advanced for evaluation in human subjects. These radiotracers may provide more biochemical and cellular specificity for investigation of neuroinflammation. They can prove useful for the development of improved anti-inflammatory drugs. Receptors acted upon by the important neurotransmitter glutamate are of interest for the study of addiction and other disorders, notably Fragile X syndrome associated with autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are examples. We have reported our comparison of two new high-performing mGlu5 radiotracers (C-11SP203 and C-11FPEB) in human subjects and our recently developed radiotracer (F-18FIMX) for a related receptor target, mGlu1. Studies in human show this radiotracer performs exceptionally well. NMDA, another protein acted upon by glutamate, is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Our research has led to promising radiotracers for imaging the NR2B binding site on the NMDA receptor. PET radiotracers can provide important quantitative information on experimental therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier and to engage with a target protein. In collaborations with academia and Pharma, we are developing several radiotracers for this purpose (e.g. radiotracers for the NR2B site). Some of these radiotracers are targeted at proteins not previously been imaged in living human brain that may have eventual clinical research utility. These proteins include subtypes of phosphodiesterase (especially with regard to depression), and the enzyme OGA (especially with regard to dementia). We are currently evaluating a very promising radiotracer for OGA in human subjects. The development of radiotracers for phosphodiesterase subtypes shows early promise and one radiotracer candidate is being progressed to human evaluation. We are advancing our methodology for improved radiotracer development. New labeling agents have been developed for C-11 chemistry, notably C-11fluoroform, which opens up wider chemical space for potential radiotracer development. We have also succeeded in developing a method for F-18fluoroform synthesis at a higher molar activity than hitherto possible, again expanding possibilities for new radiotracer development. New radiolabeling chemistries continue to be developed to utilize C-11fluoroform or F-18fluoroform for preparing new radiotracers. Sensitive mass spectrometry has been developed to measure radiotracer concentration in blood following intravenous administration, as is required to analyze PET experiments. LC-MS/MS has the potential to avoid the demanding logistics associated with measuring fast-decaying radioactivity, and we now plan to implement this methodology. Productive collaborations continue with external academic chemistry and medicinal chemistry laboratories, nationally and internationally, and with pharmaceutical companies. Productive collaborations also exist with other centers working with PET and its associated radiochemistry and radiotracer development. The laboratory is active in training new scientists for this field at graduate and postdoctoral level.We produce some useful radiotracers that have been developed elsewhere for PET investigations in animal or human subjects e.g., C-11rolipram (for PDE4 enzyme imaging), and C-11clozapine for investigation of DREADD technology. Each PET experiment requires a radiosynthesis of the radiotracer on the same day, and hence radiotracer production is a regular activity.

We are also developing longer-lived and therefore more broadly useful F-18 labeled versions of this radiotracer. We are now developing radiotracers for other targets relevant to the study of neuroinflammation, such as the cyclooxygenase (COX) subtype 1 and subtype 2 enzymes. Very promising C-11 labeled radiotracers have been identified, and two of these are now being advanced for evaluation in human subjects. These radiotracers may provide more biochemical and cellular specificity for investigation of neuroinflammation. They can prove useful for the development of improved anti-inflammatory drugs. Receptors acted upon by the important neurotransmitter glutamate are of interest for the study of addiction and other disorders, notably Fragile X syndrome associated with autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are examples. We have reported our comparison of two new high-performing mGlu5 radiotracers (C-11SP203 and C-11FPEB) in human subjects and our recently developed radiotracer (F-18FIMX) for a related receptor target, mGlu1. Studies in human show this radiotracer performs exceptionally well. NMDA, another protein acted upon by glutamate, is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Our research has led to promising radiotracers for imaging the NR2B binding site on the NMDA receptor. PET radiotracers can provide important quantitative information on experimental therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier and to engage with a target protein. In collaborations with academia and Pharma, we are developing several radiotracers for this purpose (e.g. radiotracers for the NR2B site). Some of these radiotracers are targeted at proteins not previously been imaged in living human brain that may have eventual clinical research utility. These proteins include subtypes of phosphodiesterase (especially with regard to depression), and the enzyme OGA (especially with regard to dementia). We are currently evaluating a very promising radiotracer for OGA in human subjects. The development of radiotracers for phosphodiesterase subtypes shows early promise and one radiotracer candidate is being progressed to human evaluation. We are advancing our methodology for improved radiotracer development. New labeling agents have been developed for C-11 chemistry, notably C-11fluoroform, which opens up wider chemical space for potential radiotracer development. We have also succeeded in developing a method for F-18fluoroform synthesis at a higher molar activity than hitherto possible, again expanding possibilities for new radiotracer development. New radiolabeling chemistries continue to be developed to utilize C-11fluoroform or F-18fluoroform for preparing new radiotracers. Sensitive mass spectrometry has been developed to measure radiotracer concentration in blood following intravenous administration, as is required to analyze PET experiments. LC-MS/MS has the potential to avoid the demanding logistics associated with measuring fast-decaying radioactivity, and we now plan to implement this methodology. Productive collaborations continue with external academic chemistry and medicinal chemistry laboratories, nationally and internationally, and with pharmaceutical companies. Productive collaborations also exist with other centers working with PET and its associated radiochemistry and radiotracer development. The laboratory is active in training new scientists for this field at graduate and postdoctoral level.We produce some useful radiotracers that have been developed elsewhere for PET investigations in animal or human subjects e.g., C-11rolipram (for PDE4 enzyme imaging), and C-11clozapine for investigation of DREADD technology. Each PET experiment requires a radiosynthesis of the radiotracer on the same day, and hence radiotracer production is a regular activity.

","Translational Evaluation of PET Radiotracers


","Section on PET Neuroimaging Sciences, NIMH","
For several years, we have focused on developing much-needed effective, sensitive, and reliable radioligands capable of imaging neuroinflammation. These efforts included the development of now widely-used radioligands for translocator protein (TSPO), as described in past annual reports. Building on this work, we directed our efforts towards the cyclooxygenase (COX) system, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of brain diseases, including Alzheimers Disease and major depressive disorder, and is another potential biomarker for neuroinflammation. The COX system comprises two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, which are key enzymes in neuroinflammation. To study these COX isozymes in vivo, we recently developed two novel PET radioligands: 11C-PS13, which demonstrated potent selectivity for COX-1 (IC50=1 nM) compared to COX-2 (IC50>1,000 nM) and 11C-MC1, which was potent and selective for COX-2 (IC50=1 nM) compared to COX-1 (IC50>1,000 nM). We conducted two studies to fully assess the utility of both ligands. The first sought to image the in vivo distribution of COX-1 in brain and peripheral organs using 11CPS13 in humans and rhesus monkeys as well as evaluate the in vivo selectivity of 11CPS13 for COX-1. Building on the first, the second study examined whether 11C-MC1 could image COX-2 in a model of neuroinflammation using intracerebral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in monkeys. In the COX-1 study, approximately 740 and 185 MBq of 11CPS13 were injected intravenously into rhesus monkeys, followed by dynamic PET scans. Two brain and 11 whole-body scans were obtained in human subjects, and 16 whole-body scans were obtained in monkeys. To measure the in vivo selectivity of 11CPS13, scans were also performed in monkeys pretreated with non-radioactive drugs preferential for COX-1 or COX-2; concurrent blood samples were obtained during the PET scans. In the COX-2 study, LPS was injected into the right putamen of four monkeys to elicit an inflammatory response. In two monkeys, LPS injection was repeated after a month. Dynamic brain PET scans were acquired for two hours both pre- and post-LPS injection (on Day 1). Approximately 220 MBq of radioligand was injected intravenously into the monkey before each scan. Blocking studies were also conducted with non-radioactive PS13 or MC1 (0.3-1 mg/kg) to confirm the specific uptake of the radioligands in the brain. Full quantitation with arterial sampling was done to measure distribution volume (VT). To confirm in vivo PET results, postmortem monkey brain tissues were obtained after PET scans and fluorescent in situ hybridization, immunostaining, and Western blot analyses were done.We found that 11CPS13 showed specific uptake in most major organs including spleen, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and brain under baseline conditions in both humans and monkeys. In monkeys, 11CPS13 uptake in these organs was blocked by preferential inhibitors for COX-1, but not COX-2. In human brain scans, 11CPS13 showed prominent uptake in the hippocampus, occipital cortex, thalamus, and brainstem. In the COX-2 study that used an LPS model of neuroinflammation, a widespread increase in 11C-MC1 uptake was observed in brain after the first LPS injection, which was displaced by non-radioactive MC1. An even more remarkable increase in specific uptake of 11C-MC1 was noted following the second LPS injection, especially at the injection site. In postmortem brain after the first injection, in situ hybridization showed upregulation of COX-2 transcript, which was localized primarily in neurons. Immunostaining also showed upregulation of COX-2 protein. In postmortem brain after the second injection, a necrotic lesion with white blood cells was observed, comprising primarily macrophages and neutrophils expressing COX-2. Taken together, our results indicate that COX-1 was constitutively expressed in major organs; the in vivo selectivity of 11CPS13 was also well demonstrated by pharmacological blockade in monkey. 11C-MC1 was able to image COX-2 upregulation in monkey brain. Notably, 11CPS13 and 11C-MC1 are the first radioligands for COX-1 and COX-2, respectively, that act directly at these targets. In tandem, these ligands could be used to measure COX-1 in healthy conditions and COX-2 in inflammatory disorders, and could also be used to assess drug delivery and in vivo selectivity of NSAIDs in therapeutic trials.

Precise interactions of billions of neurons drive brain functions at rest, during perception, cognition and movement. Studying these interactions is extremely challenging due to the complex spatial organization of neurons and their temporally precise communication mediated by action potentials (APs). Therefore, insight into the mechanisms of brain functions requires the simultaneous monitoring of APs in large populations of well identified neurons. Importantly, the resulting large data sets need to be understood within a conceptual framework that allows for the accurate interpretation of normal and abnormal brain dynamics. Over the last 10 years, my laboratory has discovered such a framework, and defined the term 'neuronal avalanches'. We established that neuronal avalanches are the precise spatiotemporal organization of normal neuronal population activity at rest and are scale-invariant in time, space, and group size. We published robust experimental evidence confirming the existence of neuronal avalanches in rodents, monkeys, and humans across different developmental states and experimental conditions. We established that avalanche dynamics optimize numerous aspects of information processing in cortical networks. Our long-term goal is to understand how the cortex maintains and regulates neuronal avalanches. The central hypothesis that guides our work is that neuronal avalanches are the hallmark of a normal brain in a critical state. Critical states exist in complex systems at the balance of order and disorder and are governed by universal rules. In the cortex, these rules apply to the precise spatiotemporal interactions between neurons. Our hypothesis is based on an interdisciplinary approach that combines strong experimental evidence from my group, theories from physics, and clinical data obtained at the NIH Intramural Research Program. The rationale for the proposed research is that neuronal avalanches signify normal cortical function. Deviations from neuronal avalanches may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor treatment of mental illnesses and neurological disorders. Our findings might pave the way for understanding higher cortical functions, and have been replicated and extended by several national and international groups, thereby establishing our leading role in this field. Our research provides solutions for a wide variety of fundamental problems in neuroscience and offers promising directions in translational research.

","Neuronal Avalanches in the Neocortex


","Section on Critical Brain Dynamics, NIMH","
1. Using an animal model of schizophrenia, we demonstrate for the first time that this animal model displays specific deviations from ongoing avalanche dynamics that differs from a typical imbalance of excitation/inhibition in cortex. Altered avalanche dynamics in a developmental NMDAR hypofunction model of cognitive impairment (Seshradi et al., 2018):Disturbed activity patterns in cortical networks contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ). Several lines of evidence implicate NMDA receptor hypofunction in SZ, and blocking NMDA receptor signaling during early neurodevelopment produces cognitive deficits in rodent models that resemble those seen in schizophrenic patients. However, the altered network dynamics underlying these cognitive impairments largely remain to be characterized, especially at the cellular level. Here, we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to describe pathological dynamics, occurring in parallel with cognitive dysfunction, in a developmental NMDA receptor hypofunction model. We observed increased synchrony and specific alterations in spatiotemporal activity propagation, which could be causally linked to a previously unidentified persistent bursting phenotype. This phenotype was rescued by acute treatment with the NMDA receptor co-agonist D-serine or the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen, which similarly rescued working memory performance. It was not reproduced by optogenetic inhibition of fast-spiking interneurons. These results provide novel insight into network-level abnormalities mediating the cognitive impairment induced by NMDA receptor hypofunction.2. We demonstrated for the first time that avalanche dynamics govern cortical activity even when animals process sensory information to execute movements. This generalizes the framework of avalanches and criticality from resting activity to cortical processing of sensory information and motor commands. Maintained avalanche dynamics during task-induced changes of neuronal activity in nonhuman primates (Chou et al., 2017):Sensory events, cognitive processing and motor actions correlate with transient changes in neuronal activity. In cortex, these transients form widespread spatiotemporal patterns with largely unknown statistical regularities. Here, we show that activity associated with behavioral events carry the signature of scale-invariant spatiotemporal clusters, neuronal avalanches. Using high-density microelectrode arrays in nonhuman primates, we recorded extracellular unit activity and the local field potential (LFP) in premotor and prefrontal cortex during motor and cognitive tasks. Unit activity and negative LFP deflections (nLFP) consistently changed in rate at single electrodes during tasks. Accordingly, nLFP clusters on the array deviated from scale-invariance compared to ongoing activity. Scale-invariance was recovered using 'adaptive binning', that is identifying clusters at temporal resolution given by task-induced changes in nLFP rate. Measures of LFP synchronization confirmed and computer simulations detailed our findings. We suggest optimization principles identified for avalanches during ongoing activity to apply to cortical information processing during behavior.3. We demonstrate solid evidence in sleep deprived normal human subjects and sleep deprived rats that sleep deprivation results from a deviation in avalanche dynamics due to a secondary process that interferes with ongoing critical dynamics in cortex. This introduces a new model of sleep (to recover from deviations in critical dynamics). The Interplay between Long- and Short-Range Temporal Correlations Shapes Cortex Dynamics across Vigilance States (Klaus et al., 2017):Increasing evidence suggests that cortical dynamics during wake exhibits long-range temporal correlations suitable to integrate inputs over extended periods of time to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in decision making and working memory tasks. Accordingly, sleep has been suggested as a state characterized by a breakdown of long-range correlations. However, detailed measurements of neuronal timescales that support this view have so far been lacking. Here, we show that the cortical timescales measured at the individual neuron level in freely behaving male rats change as a function of vigilance state and time awake. Although quiet wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are characterized by similar, long timescales, these long timescales are abrogated in non-REM sleep. We observe that cortex dynamics exhibits rapid transitions between long-timescale states and sleep-like states governed by short timescales even during wake. This becomes particularly evident during sleep deprivation, when the interplay between these states can lead to an increasing disruption of long timescales that are restored after sleep. Experiments and modeling identify the intrusion of neuronal offline periods as a mechanism that disrupts the long timescales arising from reverberating cortical network activity. Our results provide novel mechanistic and functional links among behavioral manifestations of sleep, wake, and sleep deprivation and specific measurable changes in the network dynamics relevant for characterizing the brain's changing information-processing capabilities. They suggest a network-level function of sleep to reorganize cortical networks toward states governed by long timescales to ensure efficient information integration for the time awake. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Lack of sleep deteriorates several key cognitive functions, yet the neuronal underpinnings of these deficits have remained elusive. Cognitive capabilities are generally believed to benefit from a neural circuit's ability to reliably integrate information. Persistent network activity characterized by long timescales may provide the basis for this integration in cortex. Here, we show that long-range temporal correlations indicated by slowly decaying autocorrelation functions in neuronal activity are dependent on vigilance states. Although wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep exhibit long timescales, these long-range correlations break down during non-REM sleep. Our findings thus suggest two distinct states in terms of timescale dynamics. During extended wake, the rapid switching to sleep-like states with short timescales can lead to an overall decline in cortical timescales.See also Decline of long-range temporal correlations in the human brain during sustained wakefulness.

The rationale for the proposed research is that neuronal avalanches signify normal cortical function. Deviations from neuronal avalanches may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor treatment of mental illnesses and neurological disorders. Our findings might pave the way for understanding higher cortical functions, and have been replicated and extended by several national and international groups, thereby establishing our leading role in this field. Our research provides solutions for a wide variety of fundamental problems in neuroscience and offers promising directions in translational research.

1. Using an animal model of schizophrenia, we demonstrate for the first time that this animal model displays specific deviations from ongoing avalanche dynamics that differs from a typical imbalance of excitation/inhibition in cortex. Altered avalanche dynamics in a developmental NMDAR hypofunction model of cognitive impairment (Seshradi et al., 2018):Disturbed activity patterns in cortical networks contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ). Several lines of evidence implicate NMDA receptor hypofunction in SZ, and blocking NMDA receptor signaling during early neurodevelopment produces cognitive deficits in rodent models that resemble those seen in schizophrenic patients. However, the altered network dynamics underlying these cognitive impairments largely remain to be characterized, especially at the cellular level. Here, we use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to describe pathological dynamics, occurring in parallel with cognitive dysfunction, in a developmental NMDA receptor hypofunction model. We observed increased synchrony and specific alterations in spatiotemporal activity propagation, which could be causally linked to a previously unidentified persistent bursting phenotype. This phenotype was rescued by acute treatment with the NMDA receptor co-agonist D-serine or the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen, which similarly rescued working memory performance. It was not reproduced by optogenetic inhibition of fast-spiking interneurons. These results provide novel insight into network-level abnormalities mediating the cognitive impairment induced by NMDA receptor hypofunction.2. We demonstrated for the first time that avalanche dynamics govern cortical activity even when animals process sensory information to execute movements. This generalizes the framework of avalanches and criticality from resting activity to cortical processing of sensory information and motor commands. Maintained avalanche dynamics during task-induced changes of neuronal activity in nonhuman primates (Chou et al., 2017):Sensory events, cognitive processing and motor actions correlate with transient changes in neuronal activity. In cortex, these transients form widespread spatiotemporal patterns with largely unknown statistical regularities. Here, we show that activity associated with behavioral events carry the signature of scale-invariant spatiotemporal clusters, neuronal avalanches. Using high-density microelectrode arrays in nonhuman primates, we recorded extracellular unit activity and the local field potential (LFP) in premotor and prefrontal cortex during motor and cognitive tasks. Unit activity and negative LFP deflections (nLFP) consistently changed in rate at single electrodes during tasks. Accordingly, nLFP clusters on the array deviated from scale-invariance compared to ongoing activity. Scale-invariance was recovered using 'adaptive binning', that is identifying clusters at temporal resolution given by task-induced changes in nLFP rate. Measures of LFP synchronization confirmed and computer simulations detailed our findings. We suggest optimization principles identified for avalanches during ongoing activity to apply to cortical information processing during behavior.3. We demonstrate solid evidence in sleep deprived normal human subjects and sleep deprived rats that sleep deprivation results from a deviation in avalanche dynamics due to a secondary process that interferes with ongoing critical dynamics in cortex. This introduces a new model of sleep (to recover from deviations in critical dynamics). The Interplay between Long- and Short-Range Temporal Correlations Shapes Cortex Dynamics across Vigilance States (Klaus et al., 2017):Increasing evidence suggests that cortical dynamics during wake exhibits long-range temporal correlations suitable to integrate inputs over extended periods of time to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in decision making and working memory tasks. Accordingly, sleep has been suggested as a state characterized by a breakdown of long-range correlations. However, detailed measurements of neuronal timescales that support this view have so far been lacking. Here, we show that the cortical timescales measured at the individual neuron level in freely behaving male rats change as a function of vigilance state and time awake. Although quiet wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are characterized by similar, long timescales, these long timescales are abrogated in non-REM sleep. We observe that cortex dynamics exhibits rapid transitions between long-timescale states and sleep-like states governed by short timescales even during wake. This becomes particularly evident during sleep deprivation, when the interplay between these states can lead to an increasing disruption of long timescales that are restored after sleep. Experiments and modeling identify the intrusion of neuronal offline periods as a mechanism that disrupts the long timescales arising from reverberating cortical network activity. Our results provide novel mechanistic and functional links among behavioral manifestations of sleep, wake, and sleep deprivation and specific measurable changes in the network dynamics relevant for characterizing the brain's changing information-processing capabilities. They suggest a network-level function of sleep to reorganize cortical networks toward states governed by long timescales to ensure efficient information integration for the time awake. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Lack of sleep deteriorates several key cognitive functions, yet the neuronal underpinnings of these deficits have remained elusive. Cognitive capabilities are generally believed to benefit from a neural circuit's ability to reliably integrate information. Persistent network activity characterized by long timescales may provide the basis for this integration in cortex. Here, we show that long-range temporal correlations indicated by slowly decaying autocorrelation functions in neuronal activity are dependent on vigilance states. Although wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep exhibit long timescales, these long-range correlations break down during non-REM sleep. Our findings thus suggest two distinct states in terms of timescale dynamics. During extended wake, the rapid switching to sleep-like states with short timescales can lead to an overall decline in cortical timescales.See also Decline of long-range temporal correlations in the human brain during sustained wakefulness.

The objective of the Section on the Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety is to better understand anxiety to reduce human suffering. We study the causes and the consequences of anxiety. We try to understand when anxiety is beneficial and when it is detrimental to our daily activities. Anxiety disorders are a major public health problem. At an estimated cost of more than $50 billion per year, anxiety disorders are extremely common. More than 40 million American adults and 10 million teenagers and children suffer from an anxiety disorder each year. However, these statistics do not consider the large number of people who struggle with anxiety but are not diagnosed with a disorder, or do not seek help. Current treatments are good, but they are not good enough. They have side-effects and do not work for everyone. Obstacles to the development of better treatments include the lack of objective signs of the disorders, poor clinical efficacy of candidate anti-anxiety drugs discovered through basic research in animals, and unsatisfactory classification due to imprecise boundaries between anxiety subtypes and to comorbidity. We believe that research on psychological and brain mechanisms will help reduce suffering from anxiety disorders. We build on our research on the psychological and neurobiological underpinnings of normal anxiety to identify malfunction in pathologic anxious states. Our research employs an experimental psychopathology approach using translational paradigms and the tools of psychophysiology, psychopharmacology, and neuroimaging. We believe that anxiety is not homogeneous. This is because anxiety is an adaptive response to threat and that different threats evoke different types of defensive responses to deal appropriately with the situation. These different responses are mediated by distinct brain circuits and it is dysfunction in these circuits that lead to maladaptive states, and, ultimately to various anxiety disorders. We make a distinction between fear and anxiety. Fear is an emergency reaction to an imminent threat, and anxiety is a more persistent state of apprehension caused by anticipation of durable and uncertain threat. While fear is a fight or flight response, anxiety is a more complex phenomenon that involves subjective feelings (e.g., worry), physiological arousal, increased vigilance, and cautious behaviors. Our aims are to: 1) identify psychophysiological and neural correlates of normal and abnormal anxiety, 2) understand how anxiety influences attentional and behavioral processes, 3) clarify how subtypes of anxiety disorders map onto the fear/anxiety distinction, and 4) develop tools to screen candidate anxiolytics and develop innovative treatments.Our research branches into 3 major projects. Project 1 examines the brain circuits mediating fear and anxiety. Project 2 focuses on the interaction between experimental anxiety and attention, feelings, and behaviors. Project 3 seeks to develop new treatments. We rely on several methods: 1) psychophysiology, with an approach strongly inspired from animal research (NCT00026559; NCT00055224), 2) neuroimaging, to elucidate the neural underpinnings of responses to threat (NCT00047853; NCT00055224, NCT02423044), with a focus on the amygdala and on a neural circuit consisting of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, habenula, dorsal raphe nucleus, hippocampus, dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the mediation and modulation of fear and anxiety. Functional brain imaging constitutes a first step toward brain-based diagnoses, endophenotypes and neurally-targeted interventions for the anxiety disorders by identifying brain correlates of these disorders; and 3) treatments, to investigate mechanisms of drug anxiolytic action, develop paradigms that facilitate the drug discovery process, and explore new treatment modalities (e.g., mindfulness-based stress reduction) (NCT02153944).

","The Psychophysiology of Fear and Anxiety


","Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety, NIMH","
This project identifies core psychological and behavioral processes and their underlying neural mechanisms related to anxiety and anxiety disorders. Using a high-spatial resolution 7 Tesla scanner, we map the functional connectivity of small structures implicated in fear and anxiety, including the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). We also characterize the effects of normal anxiety and pathological anxiety on neurocognitive and neurobehavioral processes. This work provides clues as to the boundary between normal and abnormal mechanisms, and helps identify clinical biomarkers, i.e., features that distinguish normal from abnormal anxiety. While most research focus on fear, which is an emergency flight or fight reaction to an imminent threat, our work deals with anxiety. Anxiety is a sustained state of apprehension about future and uncertain threats. Anxiety is about worries, hypervigilance, and cautious behavior, also called behavioral inhibition. We induce anxiety by threatening participants with mildly unpleasant shocks delivered on one wrist. These shocks make participants anxious, but the shocks are safe. The intensity of the shock is set by the subject themselves at the beginning of the experiment at a level that they feel uncomfortable but tolerable. Research in animals provide strong guidance to study the mechanisms underlying fear and anxiety humans. Our lab focuses more specifically on two structures, the CeA and the BNST. These structures are difficult to study in humans because of their small size. However, new powerful neuroimaging scanners now enable us to gain better insights into these brain regions. We have shown that the CeA and the BNST are connected to many of the same structures that have been identified in animals, suggesting close anatomical conservation across mammalian species (Gorka et al., 2018). However, we also found new connections with the BNST, especially in cortical regions involved in cognition, emotion regulation, and cognitive control. Thus, the BNST interacts with higher cortical regions, and may be responsible for the way we think and feel when anxious. To explore this possibility, we examined how anxiety induced experimentally changes how the CeA and the BNST communicate with the rest of the brain (Torrisi et al 2018). We found that, above all, the brain becomes more active when anxious; many cortical regions increase their communication with all other parts of the brain. The CeA also becomes more strongly connected, especially with the thalamus. The thalamus is a complex structure with many nuclei. It serves to filter sensory information, modulate arousal, and reorient attention to threat. One possibility is that the strengthening of CeAthalamus communication reflects the maintenance of salient information originating from the CeA, helping keep focus on potential threat.  While anxiety increases connectivity among many brain regions, it decreases the connectivity of BNST with cortical regions, specifically the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and with a subcortical region, the nucleus accumbens. One possible interpretation of the changes in BNST-cortical connectivity during anxiety induced by anticipation of shocks is that the brain shifts its attention from internal concerns toward monitoring the environment. This is suggested by the fact that the vmPFC and the PCC are components of the so-called default mode network, a neural circuit more particularly involved in self-referential processing and mind wandering. To make a medical diagnosis, clinicians rely on signs, which can be observed and quantified (e.g., white blood cell count), and symptoms, which are subjective information gathered via patients self-report and clinicians observation of patients. One of the main impediments to progress in anxiety research is that, unlike for many medical conditions, there is no objective sign associated with anxiety disorders. The discovery of new treatments for anxiety disorders will depend on discovering objective signs of anxiety disorders. We attempt to identify objective signs of the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of anxiety using cognitive tasks that probe basic mechanisms associated with anxiety such as hypervigilance, working memory, and behavioral inhibition. One key finding is that anxiety in control participants facilitates behavioral inhibition and cautious behavior (Grillon et al 2017). This effect can be demonstrated in go/nogo tasks in which frequent go trials (90%) are presented among infrequent nogo trials (10%). Participants must press a key when they see a O on the screen and stop their response when they see a Y.  The task is more difficult than it seems. Because there are many O (go trials) and few Y (nogo trial), over time participants develop an automatic response to go trials, which is extremely difficult to stop on nogo trials. We have shown that anxiety facilitates stopping on nogo trials, perhaps because anxiety facilitates caution and the ability to stop ongoing behavior. Such ability would be adaptive: the ability to stop ongoing movement rapidly when danger looms in the environment could help prevent detection.  Anxious patients are also better at stopping when anxious (Grillon et al 2017). However, this improvement in stopping ability to nogo trials is associated with increased error on go trials, i.e., anxious patients fail to response to go trial. In other words, anxious patients show excessive response inhibition. They adequately stop responding to nogo trials but also stop responding on a few go trials. This may be a part of a more generalized tendency to show behavioral inhibition, which is one of the characteristics of anxiety disorders. We are currently examining the neural circuits involved in response inhibition in go/nogo tasks in the hope that this will help us identify underlying neural deficits associated with behavioral inhibition in anxious patients. Executive functions refer to a set of mental skills that let people plan, organize, and complete tasks.  Thus, executive functions play a crucial regulatory role in mental health. Executive functions are impaired in anxiety; anxious patients complain that they cannot concentrate, are easily distracted, and have trouble completing tasks.  A key executive function is working memory (WM), a short-term memory system that help remember information and protect this information from distraction to guide behavior. WM provides the mental space not just to manipulate cognitive information, but also for anxious thoughts. For this reason, we examine the interaction between anxiety and WM to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the filtering distraction, mental representation of threat, and maintenance of anxious thoughts, as well as self-regulation processes. Control participants can maintain their performance on WM task during experimental anxiety because they implement executive control to filter out threat information.  However, anxious patients are distracted by their anxiety, which impairs with their WM performance, probably because they cannot implement sufficient executive control (Balderston et al 2017).  Consistent with this hypothesis, we have reported that anxious patients show poor engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a key executive control region, during such tasks (Balderston et al 2017).Taken together, we have identified several behavioral and cognitive deficits in anxious patients as we are starting to uncover the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for such deficits.  Critically, this work has the potential to dramatically change our approach to classification and treatment of anxiety disorders, and hopefully to improve the life of people suffering from anxiety.

We have shown that anxiety facilitates stopping on nogo trials, perhaps because anxiety facilitates caution and the ability to stop ongoing behavior. Such ability would be adaptive: the ability to stop ongoing movement rapidly when danger looms in the environment could help prevent detection.  Anxious patients are also better at stopping when anxious (Grillon et al 2017). However, this improvement in stopping ability to nogo trials is associated with increased error on go trials, i.e., anxious patients fail to response to go trial. In other words, anxious patients show excessive response inhibition. They adequately stop responding to nogo trials but also stop responding on a few go trials. This may be a part of a more generalized tendency to show behavioral inhibition, which is one of the characteristics of anxiety disorders. We are currently examining the neural circuits involved in response inhibition in go/nogo tasks in the hope that this will help us identify underlying neural deficits associated with behavioral inhibition in anxious patients. Executive functions refer to a set of mental skills that let people plan, organize, and complete tasks.  Thus, executive functions play a crucial regulatory role in mental health. Executive functions are impaired in anxiety; anxious patients complain that they cannot concentrate, are easily distracted, and have trouble completing tasks.  A key executive function is working memory (WM), a short-term memory system that help remember information and protect this information from distraction to guide behavior. WM provides the mental space not just to manipulate cognitive information, but also for anxious thoughts. For this reason, we examine the interaction between anxiety and WM to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the filtering distraction, mental representation of threat, and maintenance of anxious thoughts, as well as self-regulation processes. Control participants can maintain their performance on WM task during experimental anxiety because they implement executive control to filter out threat information.  However, anxious patients are distracted by their anxiety, which impairs with their WM performance, probably because they cannot implement sufficient executive control (Balderston et al 2017).  Consistent with this hypothesis, we have reported that anxious patients show poor engagement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a key executive control region, during such tasks (Balderston et al 2017).Taken together, we have identified several behavioral and cognitive deficits in anxious patients as we are starting to uncover the underlying neural mechanisms responsible for such deficits.  Critically, this work has the potential to dramatically change our approach to classification and treatment of anxiety disorders, and hopefully to improve the life of people suffering from anxiety.

The Section on Neural Function develops and applies tools for mapping the neuronal networks underlying behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We focus on developing genetically-encoded tools that can be used to functionally manipulate targeted neurons, and we use these tools to identify and characterize the functional components of neuronal networks. Our aim is to understand how these networks integrate information from the environment and the body to orchestrate ordered, goal-directed motor sequences. In broad terms, this means understanding how brains assign meaning to the signals they receive, and how they elaborate and prioritize purposeful responses to them. Because an animals priorities, purposes, and even the meanings it assigns to specific signals are potently modified by its behavioral state, we are also critically interested in understanding the determinants of behavioral states and how they act. Such knowledge is germane to a basic understanding of human mental disorders. Some, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, include dysregulation of behavioral state as a major feature, while others, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, involve deficits in initiating, terminating, or organizing behavior.Consistent with our aims, our research has focused on the neural circuitry underlying a developmentally recurring behavioral state in the fruit fly that occurs in conjunction with molting. Molting requires the execution of a stage-specific motor sequence (called an ecdysis sequence) that is used to first loosen, and then shed, the exoskeleton of the previous developmental stage. In many insects, an ecdysis sequence may also include a motor program to promote expansion and hardening of the new exoskeleton. Such a program is included in the ecdysis sequence of Drosophila at the final, adult molt, where it also serves to expand and harden the newly formed wings. Ecdysis sequences are induced by a hormone called Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH), which acts to prioritize the execution of an ecdysis sequence over other behaviors. At the time of the pupal molt, this prioritization is absolute and the animal performs an ecdysis sequence to the exclusion of any other behavior. At the adult molt, the animal initiates an ecdysis sequence, but can choose to delay execution depending on environmental conditions. By studying the neural basis of the adult ecdysis sequence, my laboratory seeks to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying behavioral decisions, whereas by studying the neural basis of the pupal ecdysis sequence our goal is to understand how hormonal signals govern behavioral state transitions and are converted into the temporally ordered motor output of the pupal ecdysis sequence. In general, our work on the ecdysis network seeks to answer basic questions about how motor sequences are initiated, sustained, and terminated and how their component programs are assembled and temporally organized by the nervous system to assure the achievement of adaptive goals. Throughout, we wish to determine what role hormones and neuromodulation play in these processes and how they prioritize the execution of certain behaviors over others. This work has as its fundamental aim, the derivation of principles of neural circuit function. The fact that few such principles exist reflects the current paucity of examples both of the specific mechanisms by which nervous systems accomplish particular tasks and of the general mechanisms by which they coordinate the execution of all tasks they face. By elucidating the functional neuroarchitectures that support the task of ecdysis, work in our laboratory thus aims to deliver insights into the general operation of all nervous systems.

","Identifying Neural Substrates of Behavior in Drosophila Melanogaster


","Section on Neural Function, NIMH","
Insect ecdysis sequences represent a simple, robust, and tractable model for studying the neuromodulatory mechanisms that govern behavior. Because initiation of an ecdysis sequence involves a profound shift in behavioral priorities, study of these sequences offers the opportunity to understand the neuromodulatory mechanisms that govern changes in behavioral state. In addition, because ecdysis behaviors are inherently sequential, they permit the systematic investigation of how motor programs are assembled and serially executed by the nervous system. Finally, the study of ecdysis sequences promises insight into how conserved circuits can be variably configured to generate immensely different behaviors. In Drosophila, for example, the motor sequences performed at pupal and adult ecdysis before and after metamorphosis, respectively are scarcely similar though they are governed by a common set of neuromodulatory/hormonal inputs. By analogy to computing, these inputs can be regarded as instructions written in a higher programming language that are then compiled into different outputs. Exposing the mechanisms of neural compilation in ecdysis is likely to deeply inform our understanding of how neuromodulators contribute to neurocomputation by reconfiguring the activity of neural networks. To investigate these questions, my laboratory seeks to elucidate the circuitry that governs both the pupal and adult ecdysis sequences in Drosophila, with our primary efforts over the last year being devoted to the circuitry governing pupal ecdysis. As noted above, pupal ecdysis is strictly dependent on intrinsic factors, a fact most evident from the observation that exogenous application of the peripherally released hormone, Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH) to an isolated pupal nervous system is sufficient to trigger sequential activation of neurons that express other key neuromodulators governing ecdysis. Evidence indicates that this sequential activation corresponds to the generation of a fictive ecdysis sequence, and our efforts over the last year have focused on characterizing the neuronal substrates of this fictive sequence using functional manipulations and Ca++ imaging. As we have previously shown, the major downstream targets of ETH include neurons that release the hormones Bursicon and CCAP (Diao et al., 2016, Genetics. 202:175-89. doi: 10.1534/genetics.115.182121). Both factors act within the nervous system as neuromodulators and have been shown to be important determinants of ecdysis sequences in all insects. However, little is known about the brain cells that mediate the effects of these factors on behavior. To identify these cells, we used the Trojan exon technique (Diao et al., 2015, Cell Rep. 10:1410-21. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.059) to target and functionally characterize neurons that express the receptors for Bursicon and CCAP.  As reported in a paper published last year in Elife (Diao et al., 2017, Elife Nov 22;6. pii: e29797. doi: 10.7554/eLife.29797), we found that each hormone acts on a functionally distinct set of neurons within the network that generates the pupal ecdysis sequence: Bursicon targets essential components of a multifunctional central pattern generator that produces the three abdominal rhythms of the pupal ecdysis sequence, while CCAP targets the motor neurons that receive the output of the central pattern generator. The neuronal targets of these two hormones, together with the neurons targeted by the initiating signal, ETH, represent three hierarchically organized layers of the neural network governing ecdysis. Remarkably, the architecture of the pupal ecdysis network is thus revealed by mapping the sites of action of the key neuromodulators governing its behavioral output. This result suggests that the neuromodulatory determinants of a behavioral state act at all levels of the neural network regulating that state to bias and coordinate specific sensorimotor outcomes.During the past year, we have also contributed to collaborative research that resulted in papers published in Elife (Lee et al., 2018, Elife, Feb 23;7. pii: e33007. doi: 10.7554/eLife.33007) and Cell Reports (Xie et al., 2018, Cell Rep. 23(2):652-665. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.068.) Both publications exploit tools developed in our laboratory. The first paper describes the use of our Trojan exon technique (Diao et al., 2015, Cell Rep. 10:1410-21. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.059) to identify a novel protein kinase involved in long-term memory in Drosophila. The second paper describes a toolkit for targeting distinct populations of dopaminergic neurons in the fly brain. This toolkit includes fly lines that express the Killer Zipper, which we designed to augment the targeting capabilities of our Split Gal4 system (Dolan et al., 2017, Genetics 206:775-784. doi: 10.1534/genetics.116.199687 ). In summary, we have made good progress during the last year in elucidating the functional architecture of the neural network that underlies execution of the pupal ecdysis sequence. At the same time, we have continued to contribute tools that support not only our own circuit mapping efforts, but also those of other members of the Drosophila research community. As we use these tools to extend and refine our analysis of the circuitry underlying ecdysis sequences at all developmental stages in the fly, our work should provide insight into the principles that govern the development and function of behavioral circuits in all organisms, including humans.

Many major psychiatric brain disorders (such as depression and schizophrenia) involve glutamate, N-acetylaspartyl glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) dysfunction. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. Together, they account for approximately 90% of total cortical synapses. Both glutamate and GABA can be detected noninvasively using a unique technique called in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This technique can noninvasively measure glutamate and GABA, and also many other chemicals (such as N-acetylaspartyl glutamate, glutathione, phosphocreatine, creatine, choline, myoinositol, and lactate) in the living brain. Our overall goals are to develop novel MRS and MRI strategies to characterize brain neurochemical profiles and dynamics, with a focus on glutamate and GABA, and to apply these techniques to studying glutamatergic and GABAergic function (protocols NCT01266577 and NCT00109174). These efforts have enabled us to address fundamental questions of glutamatergic and GABAergic functions in brain, their interactions, and mechanisms of glutamatergic and GABAergic drugs. By infusing carbon-13 labeled substrates, in particular, we can use dynamic MRS techniques to study the metabolism and neurotransmission of glutamate and GABA. Our carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques have also allowed us to noninvasively measure specific brain enzymes, and we have also been developing chemical relaxation methods for probing cell-type-specific microenvironments in brain.

","Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Imaging Studies of Brain Functions


","Section on Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, NIMH","
The goal of this research is to develop advanced magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging techniques and to apply them and other complementary methods to studying brain metabolism, neurotransmission, and enzyme activity. MRS allows measurement of the neurotransmission of glutamate and GABA in vivo, which plays important roles in many major psychiatric diseases, including depression and schizophrenia. During 2017-2018, by overcoming daunting technical challenges we successfully performed the worlds first in vivo measurement of carbonic anhydrase activity in the human brain (Li et al, Sci. Rep., 8:2328:1-8 (2018)). Carbonic anhydrase plays an important role in life. Recent proteomic studies of brain disorders such as schizophrenia and major depression have revealed significant alterations in carbonic anhydrase expression. After oral administration of uniformly 13C-labeled glucose, we performed 13C saturation transfer experiments (a technique pioneered by our group) with interleaved control spectra and carbon dioxide saturation spectra. Our results showed that the 13C signal of bicarbonate was reduced by 72% upon saturating carbon dioxide. The unidirectional dehydration rate constant of the carbonic anhydrase reaction was determined to be 0.3sec1 in the human brain. Our finding of a very large and quantifiable 13C saturation transfer effect in the human brain makes it possible to characterize this important enzyme in patients with brain disorders. We have made significant progress in the development and application of novel spectroscopic and imaging techniques for studying metabolism and neurotransmission in vivo in the brain. We invented and validated a highly novel spectral editing technique that can simultaneously measure glutamate, glutamine, GABA and glutathione without using conventional subtraction which is sensitive to motion (An et al, Magn. Reson. Med., 2018,  doi: 10.1002/mrm.27172). We discovered that, at the presence of a weak radiofrequency field, the unique evolution pattern of strongly coupled spins systems (e.g., glutamate) can be leveraged to make sharp singlets out of stronly coupled multiplet signals.  As such, multiple otherwise strongly overlapped signals can now be well determined at 7 Tesla. Since this mechanism of spectral resolution does not involve motion-sensitive subtraction it represents a significant advance in spectral editing methodology. We further validated this new technique using human studies and applied it to the  frontal lobe where structural and functional abnormalities are strongly associated with psychiatric symptoms. A subsequent Monte Carlo studies have also been performed to quantify the effectiveness of compensating radiofrequency drifts during spectral editing. We have successfully demonstrated that our retrospective frequency drift correction strategy can eliminate the detrimental effects of frequency drifts on accurate quantitative editing of brain chemicals. For characterizing cell-specific microenvironments we invented a unique echo-time independent technique for measuring chemical relaxation in vivo (Li et al, Magn. Reson. Med., 79(5):2491-2499 (2018)). Unlike all other methods, our radiofrequency-driven longitudinal steady state method does not require changing echo time to encode transverse relaxation of chemicals. Instead we used a novel radiofrequency pulse train interspersed by magnetic field gradient pulses to elicit relaxation weighting. By targeting glutamate, which is predominantly located in glutamatergic neurons, we quantified its relaxation in the prefrontal cortex using a fixed echo time that is optimized for glutamate detection at 7 Tesla. Significant progress has also been made in designing novel strategies for studying brain metabolism and neurotransmission in both human and animal experiments.

During 2017-2018, by overcoming daunting technical challenges we successfully performed the worlds first in vivo measurement of carbonic anhydrase activity in the human brain (Li et al, Sci. Rep., 8:2328:1-8 (2018)). Carbonic anhydrase plays an important role in life. Recent proteomic studies of brain disorders such as schizophrenia and major depression have revealed significant alterations in carbonic anhydrase expression. After oral administration of uniformly 13C-labeled glucose, we performed 13C saturation transfer experiments (a technique pioneered by our group) with interleaved control spectra and carbon dioxide saturation spectra. Our results showed that the 13C signal of bicarbonate was reduced by 72% upon saturating carbon dioxide. The unidirectional dehydration rate constant of the carbonic anhydrase reaction was determined to be 0.3sec1 in the human brain. Our finding of a very large and quantifiable 13C saturation transfer effect in the human brain makes it possible to characterize this important enzyme in patients with brain disorders. We have made significant progress in the development and application of novel spectroscopic and imaging techniques for studying metabolism and neurotransmission in vivo in the brain. We invented and validated a highly novel spectral editing technique that can simultaneously measure glutamate, glutamine, GABA and glutathione without using conventional subtraction which is sensitive to motion (An et al, Magn. Reson. Med., 2018,  doi: 10.1002/mrm.27172). We discovered that, at the presence of a weak radiofrequency field, the unique evolution pattern of strongly coupled spins systems (e.g., glutamate) can be leveraged to make sharp singlets out of stronly coupled multiplet signals.  As such, multiple otherwise strongly overlapped signals can now be well determined at 7 Tesla. Since this mechanism of spectral resolution does not involve motion-sensitive subtraction it represents a significant advance in spectral editing methodology. We further validated this new technique using human studies and applied it to the  frontal lobe where structural and functional abnormalities are strongly associated with psychiatric symptoms. A subsequent Monte Carlo studies have also been performed to quantify the effectiveness of compensating radiofrequency drifts during spectral editing. We have successfully demonstrated that our retrospective frequency drift correction strategy can eliminate the detrimental effects of frequency drifts on accurate quantitative editing of brain chemicals. For characterizing cell-specific microenvironments we invented a unique echo-time independent technique for measuring chemical relaxation in vivo (Li et al, Magn. Reson. Med., 79(5):2491-2499 (2018)). Unlike all other methods, our radiofrequency-driven longitudinal steady state method does not require changing echo time to encode transverse relaxation of chemicals. Instead we used a novel radiofrequency pulse train interspersed by magnetic field gradient pulses to elicit relaxation weighting. By targeting glutamate, which is predominantly located in glutamatergic neurons, we quantified its relaxation in the prefrontal cortex using a fixed echo time that is optimized for glutamate detection at 7 Tesla. Significant progress has also been made in designing novel strategies for studying brain metabolism and neurotransmission in both human and animal experiments.

This work is conducted under protocol 03-M-0211, NCT00071786.The chief goal of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Family Study of Affective and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders (NIMH Family Study) is to identify the components of the spectrum of mood disorders using the methods of genetic epidemiology, developmental psychopathology and clinical psychiatry/psychology. This study focuses on the specificity of familial transmission of disorders in the mood disorder spectrum (i.e. symptoms, symptom clusters, subtypes) and the role of comorbidity with anxiety disorders and physical disorders including migraine and cardiovascular diseases in defining subtypes of mood disorders.  The major goal of this work is to identify the core clinical and biologic factors underlying mood disorder spectrum and migraine that are familial. The major contributions of this research include: (1) identification of clinical phenotypes that breed true in families and are specific to particular subtypes of mood disorders; (2) refinement of phenotypes for the diagnostic nomenclature; (3) resolution of the role of comorbid disorders, particularly sleep disorders, anxiety and migraine, as indicators of subtypes of these disorders; and (4) elucidation of age and development-specific patterns of expression of salient components of the mood disorder spectrum across the lifespan.  The project was implemented in several phases including: (1) development of measures of the spectrum of mood and anxiety disorders in adults and children, and structured interviews for the key components of the study phenotypes including mood, sleep and headache; (2) sampling and recruitment of probands from both clinical and community settings and enrollment and evaluation of the relatives; (3) selection and implementation of measures of core features and endophenotypes for mood disorders and migraine; and (4) establishment of a high risk cohort to study the evolution of these disorders and the specificity of vulnerability markers and endophenotypes prior to clinical onset of these conditions.In order to identify the core features of mood and anxiety disorders and their overlap with sleep problems, cardiovascular diseases and migraine, we have established a set of clinical, psychophysiological and neuropsychological measures. The comprehensive set of measures in the study are divided into three components: (1) clinical information that includes a semi-structured diagnostic interview for mood and anxiety disorders; structured diagnostic interviews for major headache syndromes and sleep disorders; family history information on psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders and headache syndromes; a series of self-reported measures of symptoms, sleep patterns and personality; medical history, family structure, history and function, and major life/family events; (2) in person evaluation at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center that includes physical and neurological examination; autonomic nervous system evaluation using tilt and valsalva maneuver; laboratory measures of metabolic, cardiovascular, and immunologic function; psychophysiologic evaluation including startle reflex and eyeblink reflex; structural magnetic resonance imaging; a computerized cognitive assessment battery; and olfactory function testing; and (3) two-week assessment of daily activities including an electronic diary that assesses daily rhythms including mood, anxiety, sleep, stress, activity, diet, and social activities; heart rate reactivity using a holter monitor; activity and sleep using an actiwatch; and salivary hormones collected four times per day.

","Section on Developmental Genetic Epidemiology, NIMH","
The major aims of this project have been accomplished through the establishment of a large community-based family study of adult probands who participate in comprehensive clinical and biologic assessments followed by comparable evaluations of their adult and child relatives.  Recruitment of probands and evaluation of relatives are near completion and analyses of the findings are underway.To date, about 575 probands and about 1100 of their relatives have completed the study, including over 150 children between the ages of 7-17.  Approximately 500 individuals have also been evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center.  Probands represent a large range of disorders including mood, anxiety, sleep, migraine, and cardiovascular in addition to controls.  We are now completing interviews with relatives who had not previously participated in the study. During the past year, we have continued to recruit new probands and family members.  We are also following up the original sample, repeating interviews, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), actigraphy, and clinic measures, so that we can assess the stability of these measures over time and track their relationship with emerging mental and medical illness in probands and family members, especially offspring.  We have completed collection and genotyping of DNA samples obtained through the end of 2017, and began statistical genetic analyses. We have completed analyses of the clinical validity of our interview, the Diagnostic Interview for Affective and Anxiety Spectrum, as compared to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders, and manuscript preparation is underway.We have conducted extensive analyses of the clinical and biomarker phenotypes of familial aggregation data during the past year. We tested the familial liability for Bipolar Disorder (BPD) using the Hypomania Checklist-32 (HCL-32), an instrument specifically developed to improve detection of cases of BPD that have a primarily depressed presentation. We found a 4-factor solution for the HCL-32, and demonstrated that is a valid tool to distinguish adults who have Bipolar I Disorder (BPI) or Bipolar II Disorder from those who have major depression or no mood disorders. We also found that the HCL Distractibility/Irritability factor was familial, suggesting that this factor may underlie the familial aggregation of BPD (Glaus et al, 2018).We have also devoted substantial effort to harmonize the measures and data sets from the Lausanne Family Study with the NIMH Family Study. We plan to conduct joint analyses of the data on youth in order to confirm findings from the Lausanne study and to increase the statistical power of these analyses. We have analyzed joint data on comorbidity and co-aggregation of suicide and mental disorders, and are now conducting joint analyses of the actigraphy data in order to evaluate associations between motor activity, sleep and mental health.We continue to complete analyses on additional biomarkers that were collected on both probands and relatives. We found BPI disorder was characterized by lower average and greater variability in motor activity, and that those with BPD have greater reactivity across homeostatic regulatory systems of activity, sleep, mood and energy (Shou et al, 2017). Analyses of olfactory thresholds and detection revealed that people with BPI and major depression have deficits in odor identification, particularly attributable to the subgroup with psychotic symptoms (Kamath et al, 2018).Several studies using ecological momentary sampling have been published in the last year. We further showed that people with BPD have greater reactivity to positive events, whereas variability in mood and anxiety appears to be a trait marker of people with a history of mood disorders in general (Lamers et al, in press).  We also employed a novel statistical technique to study the stability of emotional and attention states using fragmentation models (Johns et al, in press). We have now developed new EMA scripts that will be used in several sites in order to increase the generalizability of the samples and the power of these analyses. We are also analyzing sleep patterns and disorders as well as physical activity and their associations with mood disorder subtypes.We also examined whether startle reactivity may comprise a marker of risk for anxiety disorders. We found that social anxiety is strongly associated with increased habituation and several measures of baseline startle and potentiated startle. These startle domains are also highly familial. Therefore, we plan to follow up these findings by extending the sample to include more people with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and to recruit more family members.In summary, we have identified two familial subgroups that discriminate between subtypes of mood and anxiety disorders: (1) a group with BPI disorder that are characterized by circadian rhythm dysregulation in motor activity, sleep and mood, as well as greater cross-domain reactivity (Merikangas et al, in press); and (2) a group with SAD that tend to have greater reactivity to startle than those with mood disorders or controls, elevated familial risk of suicide attempts, and secondary mood disorders. The major shift in the emphasis of the study is to follow up the sample in order to evaluate the stability of the clinical phenomena and potential biomarkers and their association with developmental manifestations of mood disorders and their core components.   Public Health Impact:Integration of the clinical, neuropsychological and psychophysiological measures within families will render an in-depth analysis of the biological mechanisms crucial for mood and anxiety disorders and their underlying diatheses. This will not only lead to a better understanding of these conditions and assist in identifying common genetic mechanisms, but may also lead to the development of novel treatment options and possible strategies for prevention and early intervention in those with elevated risk for these conditions. Future Plans:The initial findings of our study have major implications for etiology, treatment, course and nosology of mood and anxiety disorders. However, the work requires replication in larger samples, re-assessment to examine stability of the findings, and collaboration with other sites to cover the full range of the spectrum of mood disorders, and increase the power of the study.  We are now working to complete enrollment of probands, particularly with BPD and SAD, and follow up the adult and child relatives, with a particular focus on youth ages 12-30. We are also continuing to collect DNA samples in relatives, complete telephone and online assessments that are now being developed and repeat the mobile technologies measures to test their generalizability across time, seasons and clinical state. Based on the findings from analyses of the study, we plan to design and pilot interventions that stabilize regulation of activity, sleep and other daily rhythms in this and other samples. We also plan to establish a collaborative network of affiliated studies of community, high risk and clinical samples of youth with common measures of mood and motor activity.We will also continue analysis of the comprehensive measures that have been collected in this study in the following domains: Clinical phenomenology, biologic and laboratory measures, genetic analysis, and development of statistical tools and analyses for the complex dynamic phenotypes derived from actigraphy and electronic diary measures. During the past few months, several of the key papers from these measures have been published or are in press. These analyses will also help us to identify subgroups in whom more intensive follow up will allow us to understand the key clinical and biological questions addressed by this protocol.

Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a common, often severe mental illness that is one of the largest sources of death and disability. BD typically starts early in life, impairing social and occupational functioning over many years. BD is also a leading risk factor for suicide, a major cause of death in several age groups. Despite this large public health burden, relatively little is known about the causes or treatment of BD, aside from the strong contribution of genetic factors. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of genes that appear to contribute to risk for BD, but little is known about how these genes act upon brain biology.The goal of this project is to understand how particular genes act biologically to influence risk for bipolar disorder and related conditions. We study tissues ranging from blood to skin to postmortem brain. Patterns of gene expression are compared between cases and healthy volunteers, in order to reveal gene networks and pathways that are dysregulated in BD. We also employ revolutionary cellular re-programming methods that produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be differentiated into brain cells (neurons and glia) that genetically match the donor, providing a cellular model system for observing the functional impact of risk variants and testing new treatments. We also use neuroimaging data to assess the structural and functional impact of genes of interest in human volunteers. In addition to genes implicated by GWAS, sequencing, or other studies, we also study structural variations in DNA, known as copy number variants (CNVs), that may strongly influence risk for BD in particular families.

","Functional Genomics of Bipolar Disorder


","Section on the Genetic Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, NIMH","
NCT00001174In order to better interpret the impact of genetic variation on the brain biology of bipolar disorder, we are pursuing a variety of functional genomics studies, including brain imaging, RNA-sequencing in post-mortem brain tissue, and cellular phenotyping of neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. We have contributed genotypes and imaging data to the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) brain imaging consortium, which brings together imaging and genetics data from around the world in order to generate the large sample sizes needed for robust results. In addition, enrollees in our ongoing genetic study of BD in people of Anabaptist ancestry (ZIA-MH002843) are referred to UMD where they undergo diffusion tensor imaging as part of the ongoing Amish Connectome Study. Neuroimaging endophenotypes may shed light on the mechanisms whereby common genetic variants influence risk for a variety of psychiatric disorders. Following upon published pilot studies, we have completed RNA-sequencing in an additional 200 postmortem brain samples obtained from people with and without major psychiatric disorders (BD, schizophrenia and major depression). This study focused on the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, especially implicated in people with mood disorders. Gene co-expression analysis highlighted immune-related genes and pathways which are specifically expressed in microglia. Gene-level and transcript-level analyses point to a major role for alternative splicing in differentiating major psychiatric disorders. Common genetic variants implicated in risk for BD or SCZ by genome-wide association studies were significantly enriched in variants that affect gene splicing. These variants also explained a substantially greater proportion of heritability than variants affecting gene expression. The results illustrate the enormous diversity of brain-expressed transcripts, demonstrate that major psychiatric disorders can be distinguished at the transcript level, and suggest that alternative splicing is one mechanism through which differences in gene expression arise in the brain. Ongoing studies in this sample include experimental validation of differentially expressed genes and transcripts, further analysis of co-expression networks, and single-cell RNA sequencing, which will help us identify the cell-type specific genes and transcripts that are dysregulated in the brains of people with mental illness.We also seek to model the functional genomics of disease-related genes in cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) provide a renewable cellular template to conduct various investigations into disease-associated features and mechanisms at the early stage of neuronal development. This project aims to explore the ways in which we can use iPSC technology to study the biological impact of genes and genetic mutations that we identify in our other ongoing studies. Working with the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) stem cell cores we have so far successfully reprogrammed fibroblasts into iPSCs from 46 individuals ascertained in our ongoing family studies of bipolar disorder. We are growing the cells into neural progenitor cells, neurons, and glia. These cells are then studied with high-resolution microscopic imaging, electrophysiology, and gene expression methods. These data could reveal differences between control and patient-derived cells and the impact of known and novel therapeutic agents. In collaboration with Joseph Steiner (NINDS), we are developing a morphologic assay to measure the effect of known therapeutics and stressors on dendritic number and length following differentiation of NPCs into neurons. We are also exploring ways to measure the functional impact of genetic mutations at the cellular level and to use genome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 to rescue cellular phenotypes and establish a causal role for specific genetic mutations.In the coming year, we plan to expand our iPSC lines from additional families. We also plan to apply single-cell sequencing technology to iPSC-derived cells in order to explore the diversity of gene sequence and expression across individual cells from the same donor, which can be an important source of variation in human iPSC studies. The above approaches may illuminate important features that contribute to disruption of biological mechanisms during the disease process and provide reproducible assays for high throughput screening for novel therapeutics. Multigenic disorders such as BD pose special challenges for experimental studies, since a single causative mutation is usually not identifiable. For this reason, we are also studying rare, single-gene disorders whose symptoms overlap with those seen in more common mental illnesses. Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral abnormalities and disruptions in circadian rhythm. The majority of SMS cases are caused by small deletions of chromosome 17, but a few very rare cases are caused by single mutations in RAI1, a gene located within the deleted region. Study samples that carry an established single gene defect permit gene editing for comparative studies between cells with and without the causative mutation. Skin cells from people living with SMS obtained in collaboration with Ann Smith (NHGRI), the co-discoverer of SMS, have been reprogrammed into iPSCs and differentiated into neurons and other brain cells. We are using cell lines derived from three patients in order to understand the biochemical and molecular characteristics of SMS, using techniques such as qPCR, western blot, immunocytochemistry and chromatin-immunoprecipitation.   A major  aim is to discover if the mutated protein is being expressed in neural precursor cells, suggesting this protein may contribute to the disease, or whether the disease is mainly due to decreased expression of normal RAI1 (haploinsufficiency). Findings from this study may have relevance to other neuropsychiatric disorders with circadian rhythm disturbances, such as depression and BD.In the coming year, we intend to complete RNA-sequencing on neural cells derived from people with bipolar disorder, SMS, and unaffected relatives, both before and after treatment with therapeutic doses of lithium, valproic acid, and other medications. This will allow a first look at the impact of rare genetic variants, clinical diagnosis, and treatments on genome-wide patterns of gene expression.

Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a common, often severe mental illness that is one of the largest sources of death and disability. BD typically starts early in life, impairing social and occupational functioning over many years. BD is also a leading risk factor for suicide, a major cause of death in several age groups. Despite this large public health burden, relatively little is known about the causes or treatment of BD, aside from the strong contribution of genetic factors. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of genes that appear to contribute to risk for BD, but little is known about how these genes act upon brain biology.The goal of this project is to understand how particular genes act biologically to influence risk for bipolar disorder and related conditions. We study tissues ranging from blood to skin to postmortem brain. Patterns of gene expression are compared between cases and healthy volunteers, in order to reveal gene networks and pathways that are dysregulated in BD. We also employ revolutionary cellular re-programming methods that produce induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be differentiated into brain cells (neurons and glia) that genetically match the donor, providing a cellular model system for observing the functional impact of risk variants and testing new treatments. We also use neuroimaging data to assess the structural and functional impact of genes of interest in human volunteers. In addition to genes implicated by GWAS, sequencing, or other studies, we also study structural variations in DNA, known as copy number variants (CNVs), that may strongly influence risk for BD in particular families.

NCT00001174In order to better interpret the impact of genetic variation on the brain biology of bipolar disorder, we are pursuing a variety of functional genomics studies, including brain imaging, RNA-sequencing in post-mortem brain tissue, and cellular phenotyping of neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. We have contributed genotypes and imaging data to the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) brain imaging consortium, which brings together imaging and genetics data from around the world in order to generate the large sample sizes needed for robust results. In addition, enrollees in our ongoing genetic study of BD in people of Anabaptist ancestry (ZIA-MH002843) are referred to UMD where they undergo diffusion tensor imaging as part of the ongoing Amish Connectome Study. Neuroimaging endophenotypes may shed light on the mechanisms whereby common genetic variants influence risk for a variety of psychiatric disorders. Following upon published pilot studies, we have completed RNA-sequencing in an additional 200 postmortem brain samples obtained from people with and without major psychiatric disorders (BD, schizophrenia and major depression). This study focused on the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, especially implicated in people with mood disorders. Gene co-expression analysis highlighted immune-related genes and pathways which are specifically expressed in microglia. Gene-level and transcript-level analyses point to a major role for alternative splicing in differentiating major psychiatric disorders. Common genetic variants implicated in risk for BD or SCZ by genome-wide association studies were significantly enriched in variants that affect gene splicing. These variants also explained a substantially greater proportion of heritability than variants affecting gene expression. The results illustrate the enormous diversity of brain-expressed transcripts, demonstrate that major psychiatric disorders can be distinguished at the transcript level, and suggest that alternative splicing is one mechanism through which differences in gene expression arise in the brain. Ongoing studies in this sample include experimental validation of differentially expressed genes and transcripts, further analysis of co-expression networks, and single-cell RNA sequencing, which will help us identify the cell-type specific genes and transcripts that are dysregulated in the brains of people with mental illness.We also seek to model the functional genomics of disease-related genes in cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) provide a renewable cellular template to conduct various investigations into disease-associated features and mechanisms at the early stage of neuronal development. This project aims to explore the ways in which we can use iPSC technology to study the biological impact of genes and genetic mutations that we identify in our other ongoing studies. Working with the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) stem cell cores we have so far successfully reprogrammed fibroblasts into iPSCs from 46 individuals ascertained in our ongoing family studies of bipolar disorder. We are growing the cells into neural progenitor cells, neurons, and glia. These cells are then studied with high-resolution microscopic imaging, electrophysiology, and gene expression methods. These data could reveal differences between control and patient-derived cells and the impact of known and novel therapeutic agents. In collaboration with Joseph Steiner (NINDS), we are developing a morphologic assay to measure the effect of known therapeutics and stressors on dendritic number and length following differentiation of NPCs into neurons. We are also exploring ways to measure the functional impact of genetic mutations at the cellular level and to use genome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 to rescue cellular phenotypes and establish a causal role for specific genetic mutations.In the coming year, we plan to expand our iPSC lines from additional families. We also plan to apply single-cell sequencing technology to iPSC-derived cells in order to explore the diversity of gene sequence and expression across individual cells from the same donor, which can be an important source of variation in human iPSC studies. The above approaches may illuminate important features that contribute to disruption of biological mechanisms during the disease process and provide reproducible assays for high throughput screening for novel therapeutics. Multigenic disorders such as BD pose special challenges for experimental studies, since a single causative mutation is usually not identifiable. For this reason, we are also studying rare, single-gene disorders whose symptoms overlap with those seen in more common mental illnesses. Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral abnormalities and disruptions in circadian rhythm. The majority of SMS cases are caused by small deletions of chromosome 17, but a few very rare cases are caused by single mutations in RAI1, a gene located within the deleted region.

When we view the world around us, we are unaware of the enormous set of assumptions and interpretations that are inherent in visual perception.  The human brain effortlessly dissects the retinal images, extracts a hierarchy of visual building blocks, and assembles them into meaningful objects and scenes  all within a fraction of a second.  It is able to achieve this massively parallel set of operations because it has evolved to meet the enormous advantages conferred by vision: detailed perception of the environment from a safe distance. Virtually all animals use vision for some aspects of their life, as they move through cluttered environments, engage in predator/prey interactions, build nests, and forage for food.  Primates, including humans, distinguish themselves from other mammals in having a high-resolution foveal specialization of the retina that affords unusually high capacity to see detail at a distance. More than other mammalian species, humans and other primates depend on vision for social interactions, and also for the integration of vision with complex manual actions, such as reaching and grasping, or, in the case of humans, playing a musical instrument. We readily interpret visual patterns ranging from simple (e.g., the perception of light and dark) to geometric (e.g., what is in front and what is behind) to semantic (e.g., is this person trustworthy). Visual perception has always been, and remains, a central feature of our research program, as it is important for understanding key aspects of human behavior for at least two reasons. First, the faculty of vision is the key model of human sensation in general, since vision is the primary sense that humans use to interact with their environment, particularly from a distance. Second, these interpretive elements of the senses can go awry in psychiatric and neurological disorders. Our current understanding of vision rests on a shared understanding of a canonical cortical microcircuit, the visual hierarchy, dorsal and ventral pathways, and various neural representations. While these concepts have greatly advanced our understanding of the brain, they are the product of a rather narrow set of paradigms, thus it is important to continue to push in new directions if we are to understand the operational principles of human vision.At present, our two foci of research in this area are, first, the interaction between the visual cortex and the visual thalamus, and second, responses in the visual cortex to complex and dynamic natural scenes. On the first topic, we have been systematically mapping activity in the pulvinar nucleus, the largest thalamic nucleus in both human and nonhuman primates. On the second topic, we have applied new naturalistic and ""open"" paradigms to study neural responses not from the perspective of stimulus representations, but rather from the perspective of activity covariation with other brain areas.

Humans use their vision in ways that other animals do not.  For example, we learn to read very subtle facial expressions that can tell us whether a person is lying, angry, embarrassed, skeptical, or in a hurry.  We also have an unmatched capacity to use vision to steer our hands so that we can, for example, use tools or play musical instruments.  Yet despite these examples of human exceptionalism, many of our most impressive visual capacities are shared more broadly with other primates, who also use their sight for social judgements and who are also remarkably good at visually guided manual actions (e.g. in arboreal movements).  More broadly, other features of our vision are used by virtually all animals, who use it to different degrees to recognize territories, build nests, avoid predators, and find mates. While these everyday problems of animals are often downplayed as innate responses, the visual problems involved are very difficult and the brains overall approach remains poorly understood.  Vision is broadly used because it places an individual at a great advantage over its environment, allowing for the remote sensing of complex details from a safe distance.  We recently published a comprehensive review on the evolved mechanisms of high level vision (Leopold, Freiwald, and Mitchell, Evolution of Nervous Systems, ed. Kaas, 2017) and consider this perspective essential to understanding the visual brain of humans.  Much of our experimental work on visual perception centers on the brain processes shapes, objects, and scenes, starting with retinal patterns that are acted upon by specialized pathways and circuits.  How does the brain create a three-dimensional internal representation of the world for perception and manual action, given that its retinal images are inherently two-dimensional? How does it integrate visual events over different time scales?  How does our perception remain still despite the constant interruption by our own movements, and particularly eye movements? These types of questions are always present in the background as we study the mechanisms of visual perception.  In one major project, we have recently investigated how neurons in the macaque temporal cortex respond under a paradigm that departs from the standard brief presentation of flashed stimuli.  Rather than presenting stimuli for a few hundred milliseconds at a time, we allowed the subjects to view natural videos playing out over several minutes at a time.  The animals were free to scan the content of the videos, as we recorded their gaze and the activity of many neurons in different regions of the high-level visual cortex.  Our analysis also departed from convention in that we did not focus on the question what stimuli do the recorded neurons represent?, but rather we asked with which brain networks are the recorded neurons affiliated? For this, we combined our multiple single-unit recordings with data from functional MRI (fMRI), in which macaque subjects watched the same natural videos.  Given the full-brain coverage afforded by fMRI, we were then able obtain whole-brain maps of fMRI data using single-unit activity as a sort of seed or regressor.  The first paper using this method was published recently (Park et al., 2017).  It emphasized the local response diversity within a local population of temporal cortex neurons.  Perhaps most surprisingly, it demonstrated that neighboring neurons participated in very different whole-brain networks when analyzed through the seed correlation method mentioned above.  A second manuscript on this topic, comparing local populations in multiple temporal cortex areas, is currently under preparation.In a second part of this project, we have asked the question whether the temporal structure inherent in a natural video is itself an important determinant in neural selectivity.  To this end, we asked whether isolated one-second segments from a movie, when shown briefly and randomized in time, would result in similar or different neural responses to the same segments shown in context.  Our initial results suggest that a local neural population is also varied in this regard, with some neurons showing minimal temporal integration and others relying strongly on the preceding video content.  One key finding in this study, however, was that the initial visual transient response  the product of abruptly flashing the stimulus on the screen  was nearly always irrelevant to the neurons natural response pattern.  This latter finding may have profound consequences for how we think about the visual brain, since most of our understanding of the cortical microcircuit, visual hierarchy, stimulus selectivity, and functional architecture are derived from experiments in which stimuli were flashed briefly onto a screen.  It appears that under more continuous conditions, matching natural experience, the responses of neurons, and their similarity to their neighbors, presents a very different picture that may challenge current models.Our study of thalamocortical interactions has also had two successes in the past year.  In the first, we have completed a large study about visual responses in the pulvinar, the largest thalamic nucleus in primates that is ostensibly dedicated toward vision.  In that study, we measured single unit responses to a wide range of stimuli from regularly spaced intervals within the pulvinar, essentially mapping out stimulus selectivity (in a conventional sense). The results reveal some segregation of function in the pulvinar beyond the known retinotopic maps. For example, there is a concentration of neurons in and around the corticotectal tract that are notably selective for faces.  In a manuscript currently under preparation, we have compared the nature of these face-selective responses with so-called face-cells in the fMRI mapped face patches of the temporal cortex.  One of the principal findings is that many of the pulvinar face-selective neurons respond much earlier than the earliest responses in the face patches, suggesting that their face selectivity cannot be simply inherited from those areas.  We have also been examining the responses of the same neural populations to video stimuli, and are particularly interested in the extent to which particular pulvinar neurons may contribute to the same brain networks as particular neurons in the face patches.  In a second, collaborative study related to the pulvinar, we have discovered that its early disruption in marmosets affects the developmental trajectory of the dorsal visual pathway, and ultimately interferes with the normal development of visually guided grasping.  Examination of adults having undergone early postnatal lesions to a specific portion of the pulvinar, abbreviated PIm, revealed morphological changes in the dorsal visual cortex in the adult, along with permanent behavioral reaching and grasping deficits compared to control animals (Mundinano et al., 2018).  Thus the pulvinar is, in addition to its role in the adult, a critical structure for normal neurodevelopment.

Major mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and major depression are common, often severe mental illnesses. Worldwide, mood disorders are one of the largest sources of death and disability. Bipolar disorder typically starts early in life, impairing social and occupational functioning over many years. Mood disorders are also the leading risk factor for suicide, a major cause of death in several age groups. Relatively little is known about the causes of mood disorders, aside from the strong contribution of genetic factors. The long-term objective of this study is to identify genes that influence risk, clinical presentation, and treatment response in major mood disorders. We anticipate that these genes will help illuminate the pathophysiology and may point the way to better methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

","Identification of Genes Involved in Major Mood Disorders


","Section on the Genetic Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, NIMH","
NCT00001174Starting in 1993, in collaboration with 10 academic centers across the US, we recruited a large sample of over 3,000 individuals with bipolar or other mood disorders. All participants did a diagnostic interview and provided a blood sample for DNA analysis. DNA and clinical data are available through the NIMH Center for Genetics. Genetic linkage studies suggested several chromosomal regions may contain genes that contribute to mood disorders in this sample.To identify individual causal genes, we conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD) in 2007. The results implicated several genes, each of small effect, suggesting that BD is a polygenic disease. A second, larger study published in 2010 implicated a cluster of genes on chromosome 3p21 and suggested genetic overlap with major depression. An even larger study published in 2013 that included patients of Asian ancestry supported many of the previous findings and found 3 additional genetic markers of BD. Most of these findings have now been replicated in independent samples. To identify additional risk loci, last year we performed a meta-analysis of >9 million genetic variants in over 40,000 individuals, the largest published GWAS of BD to date. To increase power, we used 2,000 lithium-treated cases with a long-term diagnosis of BD from the Consortium on Lithium Genetics, excess controls, and analytic methods optimized for markers on the X-chromosome. In addition to 4 known loci, we identified 2 novel loci. Our results added to a growing list of common variants involved in BD. We also contributed genotype data from about 1000 cases to the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Bipolar Disorder Workgroup, where they were combined with another 30,000 cases and controls. Preliminary results implicate 30 independent genetic markers for BD, 20 of which have not been previously associated with BD.These large GWAS also provide a valuable set of reference data for calculating polygenic risk scores (PRS) that capture the combined influence of many alleles of small effect. We are exploring ways in which the PRS can be used to better understand individual differences in the onset, course, and presentation of BD. Recently, we used PRS to address the high rates of comorbid anxiety in bipolar disorder, a largely unexplained phenomenon. Does this comorbidity reflect shared genetic risk? Preliminary results show that among individuals with BD, genetic risk for anxiety is associated with comorbid anxiety disorders, recurrent suicide attempts, and increased adverse events during lithium therapy. Surprisingly, genetic risk for bipolar disorder itself was not related to any of these variables. In other samples, anxiety showed more genetic overlap with depression, neuroticism, and respiratory conditions than with bipolar disorder. These findings suggest that comorbid anxiety in BD reflects largely distinct contributions of bipolar and anxiety-related genes. Treatments that address this dual genetic burden may improve outcomes in people with this common comorbidity.To identify rarer genetic variants that may have a larger impact on risk for major mood disorders, we have undertaken genome sequencing studies in families and special populations. So far, we have collected more than 800 individuals from Amish and Mennonite communities whose unique genetic history makes them especially good candidates for this kind of study. All blood samples are processed by the Rutgers Cell and DNA Repository, which also establishes lymphoblastoid cell lines and distributes DNA as a resource for the general scientific community. In addition to standard psychiatric diagnostic assessments, participants are asked to complete measures of memory, concentration, and other cognitive domains, along with dimensional measures of mood and anxiety. These data will allow us to better characterize the range of phenotypes present in carriers of risk alleles, many of whom are not expected to have diagnosable mental illness. Through a collaboration with investigators at the Univ Maryland, we will also investigate brain connectivity in selected cases, using multi-modal neuroimaging. Skin biopsies are obtained on sequenced individuals and converted to fibroblasts. Several fibroblast lines have been reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells for functional genomic studies (see ZIA-MH002810-15).In collaboration with investigators at Regeneron, Inc., we have performed exome sequencing on over 800 participants. Preliminary analyses have identified a number of otherwise rare genetic variants that occur much more frequently in participants with a history of BD or a related mental illness. With this data set, we are able to look for recurrent rare mutations, as well as mutations that have accumulated within individual genes and gene-sets. The current sample size is well powered to detect variants that confer substantial risk for BD. If such variants are not detected, larger samples will be needed to detect variants that confer more modest risk of illness. The exome data are being submitted to the Bipolar Sequencing Consortium, where they will become part of a large meta-analysis that brings together samples from many groups around the world in order to improve statistical power to detect variants of modest effect.In collaboration with investigators at the Univ Pennsylvania, Univ Miami, Case Western Reserve, and Univ Kansas, we have also performed whole-genome sequencing on a larger set of individuals ascertained from Amish and Mennonite communities. The goal was to develop a population specific reference panel (the Anabaptist Genome Reference Panel or AGRP) that will allow us to infer rare genetic variants in individuals who have not undergone whole genome sequencing, thus increasing sample size at greatly reduced cost. Phase I of the AGRP was completed last year. We have set up an imputation server so outside researchers working with Anabaptist populations can use the AGRP to impute rare alleles in their own samples. We are also searching for genetic markers that help predict response to lithium, one of the most effective treatments for BD. In collaboration with Univ Bonn, we did genome-wide genotyping on over 3000 cases. Confirmed biomarkers of lithium response would be an important step forward in the care of people with BD. We organized a large international collaboration, known as the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen), aimed at characterizing lithium response in large groups of patients using reliable instruments, followed by GWAS. We found 4 markers in the same region on chromosome 21 that were associated with lithium response and supported by study in an independent sample. Subsequent analyses in this dataset demonstrated that common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia predicted poorer response to lithium and, in joint analyses, implicated additional genetic loci harboring variants involved in both lithium response and schizophrenia risk. This year we went one step further and integrated the lithium response data with the results of large-scale studies of the relationship between common genetic variation and gene expression, such as GTEX. Preliminary results highlight genes in the HLA region, known for its role in modulating immune response. In the coming year, we will seek to replicate and extend these findings in additional samples. We expect to enroll an additional 100 participants in the exome sequencing study, complete additional sequencing, and reprogram additional tissue samples.  We will also perform heritability analyses that will inform case definitions that will be used in genetic analyses of identified rare variants.

Major mood disorders such as bipolar disorder and major depression are common, often severe mental illnesses. Worldwide, mood disorders are one of the largest sources of death and disability. Bipolar disorder typically starts early in life, impairing social and occupational functioning over many years. Mood disorders are also the leading risk factor for suicide, a major cause of death in several age groups. Relatively little is known about the causes of mood disorders, aside from the strong contribution of genetic factors. The long-term objective of this study is to identify genes that influence risk, clinical presentation, and treatment response in major mood disorders. We anticipate that these genes will help illuminate the pathophysiology and may point the way to better methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. 

NCT00001174Starting in 1993, in collaboration with 10 academic centers across the US, we recruited a large sample of over 3,000 individuals with bipolar or other mood disorders. All participants did a diagnostic interview and provided a blood sample for DNA analysis. DNA and clinical data are available through the NIMH Center for Genetics. Genetic linkage studies suggested several chromosomal regions may contain genes that contribute to mood disorders in this sample.To identify individual causal genes, we conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD) in 2007. The results implicated several genes, each of small effect, suggesting that BD is a polygenic disease. A second, larger study published in 2010 implicated a cluster of genes on chromosome 3p21 and suggested genetic overlap with major depression. An even larger study published in 2013 that included patients of Asian ancestry supported many of the previous findings and found 3 additional genetic markers of BD. Most of these findings have now been replicated in independent samples. To identify additional risk loci, last year we performed a meta-analysis of >9 million genetic variants in over 40,000 individuals, the largest published GWAS of BD to date.

Major depression is a common psychiatric condition that accounts for a large burden of morbidity and mortality in the US and around the world. While effective treatments exist, many patients fail to respond to the first treatment, requiring additional trials, and even fewer remit fully. We need better methods for matching patients with the treatments that will work best for them. The goal of this study is to identify genes that contribute to treatment outcome in major depressive disorder. Outcomes studied include treatment response (improvement in symptoms over time), remission (complete recovery), and treatment-emergent adverse events. The latter includes medication side-effects, anxiety, and treatment-emergent suicidal ideation. We also seek to better understand why some depression is resistant to treatment and how social and biological factors such as  ancestry, anxiety, treatment withdrawal,  medication tolerability, and genetic differences contribute to treatment resistance.The results may provide new insights into the genetic determinants of treatment response in major depressive disorder, and may also shed light on genes contributing to risk for this common condition, with the promise of novel treatment approaches and improved targeting of existing therapies. What we learn from this study may enable a more personalized approach to antidepressant treatment, enhancing recovery while reducing costs and side effects.

","Genetic Determinants of Antidepressant Response


","Section on the Genetic Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, NIMH","
NCT00088699Strong evidence from family and twin studies demonstrates that major depressive disorder (MDD) is heritable, yet there has been limited progress in identifying the actual genes involved. A separate, perhaps overlapping set of genes is expected to play a role in individual variation in treatment response in MDD. By use of a large set of markers in many genes, we seek to characterize patients who differ in their response to standard antidepressant treatments. In the first years of this project, candidate gene studies implicated a few genes in treatment outcome and other genes in adverse effects. Future studies are needed to determine whether individuals who carry such genetic markers may benefit from closer monitoring or alternative treatments. We also participated in a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies of antidepressant outcome. Despite greater power of this combined sample to uncover association with common genetic markers, no genome-wide significant associations were found. We concluded that no common alleles of large effect on antidepressant outcome exist in these samples. Recently, we re-examined this question in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) sample using newer analysis methods that improve upon older genotyping techniques initially used in this sample. In collaboration with Dr. Yin Yao and colleagues at NIMH, we carried out a new genome wide association study of antidepressant response in the STAR*D sample.. We identified several SNPs associated with outcome after 12 weeks of treatment with citalopram, and several different SNPs that were associated with outcome after 12 weeks. Heritability was greater for outcomes following longer treatment periods, an unexpected finding that suggests the shorter treatment durations typically used in pharmacogenomic studies may not be optimal. Ongoing work is aimed at replicating these finding in additional samples. We are also using new, high-throughput sequencing methods to test for rarer genetic variants that may exert larger effects, at least in patients with treatment resistant depression. Such variants may show larger effects, especially among patients with unusual treatment outcomes. Patients who respond to antidepressant treatment constitute a mixture of true responders, placebo responders, and those whose illness remits spontaneously. Patients who fail to respond to multiple treatments may be less heterogeneous, since placebo responders and spontaneous remitters are removed. From over 4,000 patients enrolled in the STAR*D study, we found that only 10% show treatment resistance that is not explained by non-adherence, comorbid substance use disorder, or other factors, and only 3% are highly treatment-resistant.Sequencing of the coding regions of the genome (exome) has now been completed on over 175  treatment-resistant (TRD) or  ""typically responsive"" patients drawn from the STAR*D, the Univ. Michigan Depression Center, and NIMH studies of novel antidepressants such as ketamine and scopolamine. Much of the exome sequencing was carried out at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center with funds provided by the NIH Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO) program, which also provided exome sequence from about 200 non-psychiatric patients for comparison. Of the 350,000 high-quality genetic variants  identified, about 15,000 were found to be rare, potentially-damaging variants within the protein-coding regions of genes. Some of these variants appeared in up to 6 TRD cases, although they were not detected in other sequenced patients. Nevertheless, no variant, gene, or gene set was found to be significantly associated with TRD after correction for multiple testing.  In the coming year, we plan to expand the sample size, incorporate information on common genetic variants, identify copy number variants, and consider variants in non-coding regions. Taken together, these approaches may increase power and identify genes more robustly associated with resistance to anti-depressant treatment.

The goal of this laboratory is to develop, evaluate, and implement new probes to examine the chemistry of the living brain with positron emission tomography (PET). With this technique, miniscule doses of a radioactively labeled drug are administered to a subject. The drug travels to the brain and binds to specific target sites, called receptors. The distribution and density of these targets in the brain can be measured with a PET camera. Although some of the PET radiolabeled drugs might be used for diagnostic purposes, the major use of these agents is to study the pathophysiology of disease.

","Clinical Evaluation of PET Radiotracers


","Section on PET Neuroimaging Sciences, NIMH","
Examples of progress made during the prior year are summarized below.1. Replication of the finding that PET radioligand binding to TSPO, a putative biomarker of inflammation, is increased during major depressive episodesTranslocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a potential biomarker of neuroinflammation, can be accurately quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and 11CPBR28, a TSPO tracer. A recent study found increased TSPO binding in multiple brain regions in unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) currently experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE). Building on this work, we sought to: 1) replicate these findings using a different patient population and a different tracer; 2) investigate the effects of antidepressants on TSPO binding in these subjects; and 3) determine the relationship of peripheral and central inflammatory markers to TSPO binding. Towards this end, unmedicated MDD subjects (n = 12), medicated MDD subjects (n = 16), and healthy controls (n = 20) underwent PET imaging using 11CPBR28. Total distribution volume (VT) was measured using arterial input function and corrected for TSPO genotype. The subgenual prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were chosen as regions of interest. Peripheral blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid were analyzed to investigate the relationship between peripheral and central inflammatory markers and TSPO binding. We found that TSPO binding was higher in MDD subjects versus healthy controls in both the subgenual prefrontal cortex as well as the anterior cingulate cortex, though these comparisons missed the corrected threshold for statistical significance (=.025). Exploratory analyses demonstrated that unmedicated MDD subjects had the highest levels of TSPO binding, followed by medicated MDD subjects, who did not differ from healthy controls. TSPO binding correlated with interleukin-5 (IL-5) in cerebrospinal fluid but with no other peripheral or central inflammatory markers. The findings reveal an important trend towards increased TSPO binding in the brains of MDD subjects, and the post hoc analysis extended these findings by demonstrating that this abnormality was significant in unmedicated (but not medicated) MDD subjects. Taken together, our results replicated previous findings showing increased TSPO binding in the brain of MDD subjects experiencing an MDE, suggesting that inflammation is a key target for developing novel therapeutics to treat MDD. The findings are particularly important because they may help further elucidate pathways involved in the development of MDD as well as identify potential novel treatments and pharmacological targets. This work was performed under clinical protocol NCT01851356.2. 11C-ER176, a newly developed radioligand for 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), has adequate sensitivity to successfully image all three affinity genotypes in human brainPrevious work from our laboratory demonstrated that most second-generation positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands used to measure 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker of neuroinflammation, were sensitive to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6971. To address this issue, our laboratory developed 11C-ER176; we found that this ligand showed little sensitivity to rs6971 when tested in vitro and, furthermore, had high specific binding in monkey brain. We then sought to determine whether the sensitivity of 11C-ER176 in humans was similar to the low sensitivity measured in vitro. A secondary goal of the study was to measure the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND, or the ratio of specific-to-nondisplaceable uptake) of 11C-ER176 in human brain.Towards this end, nine healthy volunteers, three high-affinity binders (HABs), three mixed-affinity binders (MABs), and three low-affinity binders (LABs) were studied with whole-body 11C-ER176 PET imaging. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) from 60 to 120 minutes after injection derived from each organ were compared between genotypes. In addition, eight separate healthy volunteers, three HABs, three MABs, and two LABs underwent brain PET imaging. The three HABs underwent a repeated brain scan after TSPO blockade with XBD173 to determine nondisplaceable distribution volume (VND) via Lassen occupancy plotting and thereby estimate BPND in brain.We found that regional SUVs averaged from 60 to 120 minutes post- injection in brain and peripheral organs with high TSPO densities (for instance, lung and spleen) were greater in HABs than in LABs. On the basis of VND determined via the occupancy plot, the whole-brain BPND for LABs was estimated to be 1.4 0.8, which was much lower than that for HABs (4.2 1.3) but about the same as that for HABs with 11C-PBR28 (1.2).These important findings suggest that a clear in vivo sensitivity to rs6971 was observed with 11C-ER176 that had not been expected from in vitro studies. Notably, this suggests that the future development of any improved radioligand for TSPO should consider the possibility that in vitro properties will not be reflected in vivo. We also found that 11C-ER176 had adequately high BPND for all rs6971 genotypes. Thus, the new radioligand would likely have greater sensitivity for detecting abnormalities in patients. This work was performed under clinical protocols NCT02147392 and NCT02181582.3. Decreased cannabinoid CB1 receptors in male tobacco smokers examinedThe Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB) previously conducted several studies that identified reductions of brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors in adults with cannabis and alcohol use disorders. In addition, preclinical studies suggested that these cannabinoid receptors also contributed to nicotine reward and dependence. Of particular relevance to the MIBs work with neuropsychiatric populations, many patients with such disorders smoke tobacco, which may confound clinical studies of psychiatric disorders. We conducted a study to ascertain whether human subjects who smoke tobacco but are otherwise healthy have altered CB1 receptor binding in brain. Towards this end, we measured CB1 receptors in the brains of 18 healthy men who smoke tobacco (frequent chronic cigarette smokers), and 28 healthy men who do not smoke tobacco, using positron emission tomography (PET) and 18FFMPEP-d2, a radioligand for CB1 receptors. We collected arterial blood samples during scanning to calculate the distribution volume (VT), which is nearly proportional to CB1 receptor density. Repeated measures analysis of variance compared VT between groups in various brain regions.Our results indicated that brain CB1 receptor VT was about 20% lower in subjects who smoked tobacco than in subjects who did not. Decreased VT was found in all brain regions, but reductions did not correlate with years of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, or measures of nicotine dependence. The results indicate that tobacco-smoking healthy men had a widespread reduction in CB1 receptor density in brain. Because CB1 receptor reductions appear to be a common feature of substance use disorders, the findings suggest that future clinical studies of CB1 receptors should control for tobacco smoking. This work was performed under clinical protocol NCT00816439.

The goal of this laboratory is to develop, evaluate, and implement new probes to examine the chemistry of the living brain with positron emission tomography (PET). With this technique, miniscule doses of a radioactively labeled drug are administered to a subject. The drug travels to the brain and binds to specific target sites, called receptors. The distribution and density of these targets in the brain can be measured with a PET camera. Although some of the PET radiolabeled drugs might be used for diagnostic purposes, the major use of these agents is to study the pathophysiology of disease.

Examples of progress made during the prior year are summarized below.1. Replication of the finding that PET radioligand binding to TSPO, a putative biomarker of inflammation, is increased during major depressive episodesTranslocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a potential biomarker of neuroinflammation, can be accurately quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and 11CPBR28, a TSPO tracer. A recent study found increased TSPO binding in multiple brain regions in unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) currently experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE). Building on this work, we sought to: 1) replicate these findings using a different patient population and a different tracer; 2) investigate the effects of antidepressants on TSPO binding in these subjects; and 3) determine the relationship of peripheral and central inflammatory markers to TSPO binding. Towards this end, unmedicated MDD subjects (n = 12), medicated MDD subjects (n = 16), and healthy controls (n = 20) underwent PET imaging using 11CPBR28. Total distribution volume (VT) was measured using arterial input function and corrected for TSPO genotype. The subgenual prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were chosen as regions of interest. Peripheral blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid were analyzed to investigate the relationship between peripheral and central inflammatory markers and TSPO binding. We found that TSPO binding was higher in MDD subjects versus healthy controls in both the subgenual prefrontal cortex as well as the anterior cingulate cortex, though these comparisons missed the corrected threshold for statistical significance (=.025). Exploratory analyses demonstrated that unmedicated MDD subjects had the highest levels of TSPO binding, followed by medicated MDD subjects, who did not differ from healthy controls. TSPO binding correlated with interleukin-5 (IL-5) in cerebrospinal fluid but with no other peripheral or central inflammatory markers. The findings reveal an important trend towards increased TSPO binding in the brains of MDD subjects, and the post hoc analysis extended these findings by demonstrating that this abnormality was significant in unmedicated (but not medicated) MDD subjects. Taken together, our results replicated previous findings showing increased TSPO binding in the brain of MDD subjects experiencing an MDE, suggesting that inflammation is a key target for developing novel therapeutics to treat MDD. The findings are particularly important because they may help further elucidate pathways involved in the development of MDD as well as identify potential novel treatments and pharmacological targets. This work was performed under clinical protocol NCT01851356.2. 11C-ER176, a newly developed radioligand for 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), has adequate sensitivity to successfully image all three affinity genotypes in human brainPrevious work from our laboratory demonstrated that most second-generation positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands used to measure 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker of neuroinflammation, were sensitive to the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6971. To address this issue, our laboratory developed 11C-ER176; we found that this ligand showed little sensitivity to rs6971 when tested in vitro and, furthermore, had high specific binding in monkey brain. We then sought to determine whether the sensitivity of 11C-ER176 in humans was similar to the low sensitivity measured in vitro. A secondary goal of the study was to measure the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND, or the ratio of specific-to-nondisplaceable uptake) of 11C-ER176 in human brain.Towards this end, nine healthy volunteers, three high-affinity binders (HABs), three mixed-affinity binders (MABs), and three low-affinity binders (LABs) were studied with whole-body 11C-ER176 PET imaging. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) from 60 to 120 minutes after injection derived from each organ were compared between genotypes. In addition, eight separate healthy volunteers, three HABs, three MABs, and two LABs underwent brain PET imaging. The three HABs underwent a repeated brain scan after TSPO blockade with XBD173 to determine nondisplaceable distribution volume (VND) via Lassen occupancy plotting and thereby estimate BPND in brain.We found that regional SUVs averaged from 60 to 120 minutes post- injection in brain and peripheral organs with high TSPO densities (for instance, lung and spleen) were greater in HABs than in LABs. On the basis of VND determined via the occupancy plot, the whole-brain BPND for LABs was estimated to be 1.4 0.8, which was much lower than that for HABs (4.2 1.3) but about the same as that for HABs with 11C-PBR28 (1.2).These important findings suggest that a clear in vivo sensitivity to rs6971 was observed with 11C-ER176 that had not been expected from in vitro studies. Notably, this suggests that the future development of any improved radioligand for TSPO should consider the possibility that in vitro properties will not be reflected in vivo.

Mood Disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder) are life-impairing, linked with premature death and a chronic course of illness. Major depression is more disabling than most of the other chronic medical illnesses. Our lab demonstrated that ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, produces a rapid antidepressant, anti-anhedonic (restores impaired pleasure), antisuicidal effect, and anti-fatigue effects (within hours) in patients with treatment-resistant depression and suicidal thinking. The improvement to standard treatments (antidepressants and psychotherapy) usually takes 6 weeks or longer. Our finding of rapid antidepressant effects with ketamine is a major breakthrough  and has generated considerable interest, across stakeholders, in developing drugs that have a rapid onset of antidepressant action (efficacy within hours). We are now examining the mechanisms of action of response to ketamine in major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and suicidal ideation, and are searching for biomarkers of this rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal response. Identifying the neural signatures of rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal response to ketamine would help develop other treatments that also result in rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects.Predictors and neural correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine: protocols 04-M-0222 (NCT00088699) and 17-M-0060 (NCT03065335)Aims 1) To identify the neural correlates of the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine in subjects with major depressive disorder treatment-resistant depression, and 2) To identify the biomarkers that are associated with response and relapse to ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder.Primary Outcome Measure: clinical, imaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological, and biochemical (e.g., genetics, microRNA, BDNF, metabolomics).

","Glutamatergic Modulators for Rapid and Sustained Antidepressant Effect


","Section on Neurobiology and Treatment of Mood Disorders, NIMH","
Our results indicate that the glutamatergic system is involved in the mechanism of action of rapid antidepressant response. In addition, this system may be a feasible target for developing treatments that have rapid and robust efficacy in individuals who have treatment-resistant depression and suicidal thoughts. We found that the glutamatergic modulator ketamine resulted in rapid, robust and relatively sustained antidepressant, antisuicidal, and antianhedonic effects. Response with ketamine occurred within 2 hours and lasted approximately 1 week. Comparable response rates with standard of care treatments occur at 6-8 weeks instead of hours. Study: (Biomarkers of rapid response in major depressive disorder): protocols 04-M-0222 (NCT00088699) and 17-M-0060 (NCT03065335).OBJECTIVE: To identify the neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to the NMDA antagonist ketamine in subjects with major depressive disorder. We found robust and rapid antidepressant effects resulted from a single intravenous dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist (ketamine); onset occurred within 2 hours post-infusion and continued to remain significant for 1 week. Aims are 1) to examine the antisuicidal effects of ketamine, and 2) to examine correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder and include these data/outcome measures: clinical (e.g., family history), imaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography MEG, electroencephalography EEG), neuropsychological, and biochemical (e.g., genetics, microRNA, BDNF, metabolomics), 3) To demonstrate more robust neuropharmacodynamic effects measured by neuropharmacodynamic imaging (fMRI+EEG and MEG) of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg as compared to placebo administered over 40 minutes. Secondary Outcome Measures: To determine if increases in synaptic plasticity, using electrophysiological measures in response to TMS and in association with sleep (i.e. slow wave sleep EEG activity) are associated with better antidepressant response to 0.5 mg/kg Time Frame: baseline and post-drug To demonstrate enhanced efficacy, as measured by the MADRS, of IV ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in participants with MDD using a psychophysiological technique (i.e. NPU-threat test). Time Frame: baseline and post-drug To identify baseline peripheral measures associated with response to the administration of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, as potential biomarkers of acute (24 hour) treatment response. Time Frame: baseline and post-drug Results in the past year:1.	Ketamine produces rapid, robust, and fairly sustained antisuicidal ideation effects. Our past work, found that ketamine rapidly reduced suicidal thoughts, with effects lasting up to one week in patients across a range of depressive and non-depressive diagnoses. Suicide is a public health crisis with limited treatment options. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis examining the effects of a single dose of ketamine on suicidal ideation. We found that ketamine rapidly (within 1 day) reduced suicidal ideation significantly. Effect sizes were moderate to large at all time points after dosing. We conclude that ketamine rapidly reduced suicidal thoughts, within 1 day and for up to 1 week in depressed patients with suicidal ideation. Ketamine's effects on suicidal ideation were partially independent of its effects on mood. 2.	Default Mode Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder After Ketamine Administration. The symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are rapidly alleviated by administration of a single dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine. However, few studies have investigated the potential sustained neural effects of this agent beyond immediate infusion. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of a single ketamine infusion on the resting state default mode network (DMN) at 2 and 10 days after a single ketamine infusion in unmedicated subjects with MDD as well as healthy control subjects (HCs). Data were from a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 58 participants who received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 separate test days spaced 2 weeks apart. Eight minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data was acquired at baseline and at about 2 and 10 days after both infusions. In subjects with MDD, connectivity between the insula and the DMN was normalized compared with HCs 2 days postketamine infusion. Group-specific connectivity differences in drug response were observed, most notably in the insula in subjects with MDD and in the thalamus in HCs. In conclusion, connectivity changes in the insula in subjects with MDD suggest that ketamine may normalize the interaction between the DMN and salience networks, supporting the triple network dysfunction model of MDD.3.	Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression. Modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free MDD subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an intravenous saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and six to nine hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Both MDD and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with MDD subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections, and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our MDD subject group, ketamine efficacy-as measured by improved mood ratings-correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that DCM is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.4.	7T 1H-MRS in major depressive disorder: a Ketamine Treatment Study. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is the only non-invasive method able to directly measure glutamate levels in vivo; in particular, glutamate and glutamine metabolite concentrations are separable by 1H-MRS at 7T. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study that included 1H-MRS scans at baseline and at 24h post ketamine and post-placebo infusions sought to determine glutamate levels in the pregenual anterior cingulate (pgACC) of 20 medication-free MDD subjects and 17 healthy volunteers (HVs) 24h post ketamine administration, and to evaluate any other measured metabolite changes, correlates, or predictors of antidepressant response. No significant between-group differences in 1H-MRS-measured metabolites were observed at baseline. Antidepressant response was not predicted by baseline glutamate levels. Our results suggest that any infusion-induced increases in glutamate at the 24-h post ketamine time point were below the sensitivity of the current technique; that these increases may occur in different brain regions than the pgACC; or that subgroups of MDD subjects may exist that have a differential glutamate response to ketamine.

Mood Disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder) are life-impairing, linked with premature death and a chronic course of illness. Major depression is more disabling than most of the other chronic medical illnesses. Our lab demonstrated that ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, produces a rapid antidepressant, anti-anhedonic (restores impaired pleasure), antisuicidal effect, and anti-fatigue effects (within hours) in patients with treatment-resistant depression and suicidal thinking. The improvement to standard treatments (antidepressants and psychotherapy) usually takes 6 weeks or longer. Our finding of rapid antidepressant effects with ketamine is a major breakthrough  and has generated considerable interest, across stakeholders, in developing drugs that have a rapid onset of antidepressant action (efficacy within hours). We are now examining the mechanisms of action of response to ketamine in major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and suicidal ideation, and are searching for biomarkers of this rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal response. Identifying the neural signatures of rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal response to ketamine would help develop other treatments that also result in rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects.Predictors and neural correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine: protocols 04-M-0222 (NCT00088699) and 17-M-0060 (NCT03065335)Aims 1) To identify the neural correlates of the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine in subjects with major depressive disorder treatment-resistant depression, and 2) To identify the biomarkers that are associated with response and relapse to ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder.Primary Outcome Measure: clinical, imaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography (MEG), electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological, and biochemical (e.g., genetics, microRNA, BDNF, metabolomics).  Change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores.Secondary Outcome Measures: Change in Hamilton Depression Rating (HDRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinician Administered Dissociative States scale (CADSS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale total scores, and Scale Suicide Ideation (SSI). 

Our results indicate that the glutamatergic system is involved in the mechanism of action of rapid antidepressant response. In addition, this system may be a feasible target for developing treatments that have rapid and robust efficacy in individuals who have treatment-resistant depression and suicidal thoughts. We found that the glutamatergic modulator ketamine resulted in rapid, robust and relatively sustained antidepressant, antisuicidal, and antianhedonic effects. Response with ketamine occurred within 2 hours and lasted approximately 1 week. Comparable response rates with standard of care treatments occur at 6-8 weeks instead of hours. Study: (Biomarkers of rapid response in major depressive disorder): protocols 04-M-0222 (NCT00088699) and 17-M-0060 (NCT03065335).OBJECTIVE: To identify the neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to the NMDA antagonist ketamine in subjects with major depressive disorder. We found robust and rapid antidepressant effects resulted from a single intravenous dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist (ketamine); onset occurred within 2 hours post-infusion and continued to remain significant for 1 week. Aims are 1) to examine the antisuicidal effects of ketamine, and 2) to examine correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder and include these data/outcome measures: clinical (e.g., family history), imaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography MEG, electroencephalography EEG), neuropsychological, and biochemical (e.g., genetics, microRNA, BDNF, metabolomics), 3) To demonstrate more robust neuropharmacodynamic effects measured by neuropharmacodynamic imaging (fMRI+EEG and MEG) of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg as compared to placebo administered over 40 minutes. Secondary Outcome Measures: To determine if increases in synaptic plasticity, using electrophysiological measures in response to TMS and in association with sleep (i.e. slow wave sleep EEG activity) are associated with better antidepressant response to 0.5 mg/kg Time Frame: baseline and post-drug To demonstrate enhanced efficacy, as measured by the MADRS, of IV ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in participants with MDD using a psychophysiological technique (i.e. NPU-threat test). Time Frame: baseline and post-drug To identify baseline peripheral measures associated with response to the administration of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, as potential biomarkers of acute (24 hour) treatment response. Time Frame: baseline and post-drug Results in the past year:1.	Ketamine produces rapid, robust, and fairly sustained antisuicidal ideation effects. Our past work, found that ketamine rapidly reduced suicidal thoughts, with effects lasting up to one week in patients across a range of depressive and non-depressive diagnoses. Suicide is a public health crisis with limited treatment options. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis examining the effects of a single dose of ketamine on suicidal ideation. We found that ketamine rapidly (within 1 day) reduced suicidal ideation significantly. Effect sizes were moderate to large at all time points after dosing. We conclude that ketamine rapidly reduced suicidal thoughts, within 1 day and for up to 1 week in depressed patients with suicidal ideation. Ketamine's effects on suicidal ideation were partially independent of its effects on mood. 2.	Default Mode Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder After Ketamine Administration. The symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are rapidly alleviated by administration of a single dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine. However, few studies have investigated the potential sustained neural effects of this agent beyond immediate infusion. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of a single ketamine infusion on the resting state default mode network (DMN) at 2 and 10 days after a single ketamine infusion in unmedicated subjects with MDD as well as healthy control subjects (HCs). Data were from a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 58 participants who received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 separate test days spaced 2 weeks apart. Eight minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data was acquired at baseline and at about 2 and 10 days after both infusions. In subjects with MDD, connectivity between the insula and the DMN was normalized compared with HCs 2 days postketamine infusion. Group-specific connectivity differences in drug response were observed, most notably in the insula in subjects with MDD and in the thalamus in HCs. In conclusion, connectivity changes in the insula in subjects with MDD suggest that ketamine may normalize the interaction between the DMN and salience networks, supporting the triple network dysfunction model of MDD.3.	Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression. Modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free MDD subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an intravenous saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and six to nine hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Both MDD and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with MDD subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections, and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our MDD subject group, ketamine efficacy-as measured by improved mood ratings-correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. In conclusion, these findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that DCM is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.4.	7T 1H-MRS in major depressive disorder: a Ketamine Treatment Study. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is the only non-invasive method able to directly measure glutamate levels in vivo; in particular, glutamate and glutamine metabolite concentrations are separable by 1H-MRS at 7T. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study that included 1H-MRS scans at baseline and at 24h post ketamine and post-placebo infusions sought to determine glutamate levels in the pregenual anterior cingulate (pgACC) of 20 medication-free MDD subjects and 17 healthy volunteers (HVs) 24h post ketamine administration, and to evaluate any other measured metabolite changes, correlates, or predictors of antidepressant response. No significant between-group differences in 1H-MRS-measured metabolites were observed at baseline. Antidepressant response was not predicted by baseline glutamate levels. Our results suggest that any infusion-induced increases in glutamate at the 24-h post ketamine time point were below the sensitivity of the current technique; that these increases may occur in different brain regions than the pgACC; or that subgroups of MDD subjects may exist that have a differential glutamate response to ketamine.

The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch, combines multimodal neuroimaging methodologies (functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, sMRI) and positron emission tomography PET), genetics, and behavior to investigate Williams syndrome (WS), a rare disorder caused by a hemizygous deletion of approximately 25 genes on chromosome 7, typically by spontaneous mutation. The incidence is between one in 7500 and one in 20,000 live births. With its unique profile of striking behavioral features, such as hypersociability, combined with differential impact on cognitive functions, some only mildly affected while others, particularly visuospatial construction, severely impaired, WS is an intriguing experiment of nature that raises fundamental questions about the neurogenetic mechanisms of social behavior and of cognition, the modularity of mind, and brain plasticity in development. Because the genes involved in WS are known, the study of neural mechanisms in WS affords a privileged setting for investigating genetic influences on complex brain functions from the bottom-up. Studying this rare genetically-based neurodevelopmental disorder allows us to closely examine the genetic determinants of the function, structure, and organization of neural systems relevant to cognition and behavior, including, particularly, 1) the neural basis of genetically-determined visuospatial construction abilities and 2) the neural mechanisms by which genetic factors influence social behavior and cognition. Our studies compare high functioning groups of people with genetic abnormalities in the Williams syndrome region of chromosome 7 with healthy individuals matched for age, sex, and handedness, and with similar IQ. By thus controlling for IQ, we minimize the possibility that factors such as intellectual disability or developmental level would influence interpretation of brain results. Working within this model human system extends and complements efforts to understand genetic mechanisms of behavior, and its pathologies, in the general population and in neuropsychiatric disorders where contributions of individual genes are small and phenotypes may be subtle and complex.Our studies of the neurobiology of WS are a multi-pronged effort:1) We continue to refine our knowledge of the WS brain phenotype in adults with the full deletion. In this population, we aim to further explicate hippocampal, fronto-amygdalar, and dorsal visual stream abnormalities by employing multi-channel structural and diffusion tensor MRI methods as well as new visuospatial and social cognitive probes for fMRI.2) We apply our multimodal imaging battery to individuals with smaller deletions to better associate components of the neurobiological phenotype with specific genes.3) Using our knowledge of the adult WS brain phenotype as a template, we continue to explore the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in WS-related genes in the general population.4) Lastly, to study the development of the genetically-driven anomalies of brain structure and function in WS, a major initiative is a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study of high functioning children with the full WS deletion, smaller deletions, and duplications (Dup7) of the WS critical region. Study of persons with smaller deletions lends invaluable insights into the contributions of specific genes to aspects of the WS phenotype. Study of persons with Dup7, in which the WS critical region is duplicated (yielding three gene copies) rather than deleted as in WS (wherein there is only a single copy of affected genes), along with the opposing phenotypes in Dup7, such as autistic traits and retained visuospatial functions offers opportunities to understand gene dosage effects. Our experience and success in defining the adult WS brain phenotype, together with the collaborative and in-house expertise in neurodevelopment, provide a unique opportunity to make major advances in this area.

","Multimodal Neuroimaging of Gene-Brain Relationships in Williams Syndrome


","Section on Integrative Neuroimaging, NIMH","
The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to work toward discovery of novel genetic contributions to brain structure, function, and clinically relevant behavior and cognition, through a series of ongoing multimodal neuroimaging studies of individuals with copy number variation in the 7q11.23 Williams Syndrome (WS) genomic region (hemizygous microdeletion or duplication of a contiguous segment of DNA at this locus). These studies have been responsible for seminal advances in elaborating the neural underpinnings of both visuospatial and socio-emotional aspects of the 7q11.23 phenotype. Via multiple neuroimaging techniques, including voxel- and surface-based cortical morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI, we have established that the visuospatial construction deficits in WS are linked to convergent intraparietal sulcus alterations. Specifically, in this brain region, we have shown that individuals with WS harbor disrupted neural integrity, altered activation during spatial judgments, gray matter volume and sulcal depth reductions, and associated neural fiber tract anomalies. Likewise, in pursuit of systems-level correlates of the hypersociability and non-social anxiety observed in WS, we have found decreased amygdala activation evoked by fearful face stimuli and conversely, increased amygdala response to non-social frightening stimuli, abnormalities that were linked to altered prefrontal regulation in structural equation models. We have also identified convergent alterations in anterior insula structure, function, and inter-regional connectivity, which predict the characteristic WS personality. Efforts this year have focused on data collection of these same structural and functional measurements of visuospatial and socio-emotional systems integrity in a growing cohort of children with and without WS critical region copy number variation (i.e., individuals with one WS, two typically developing, or three Dup7 copies of affected genes in the WS critical region) as part of our longitudinal WS neurodevelopmental initiative. In proof-of-concept work aimed at establishing neurostructural gene-dosage effects, we have studied microanatomical measures and found increasing overall brain size (Dup7>TD>WS), but decreasing relative cerebellar size (WS>TD>Dup7) with copy number of affected genes. Interestingly, both of these Dup7 phenotypes (larger brain size and relatively smaller cerebellum) have been described in the autism literature, particularly in boys, although these findings are not without controversy. Following this work, we are undertaking similar gene-dosage analyses of more localized morphometry throughout the brain, as well as local gyrification index and resting-state whole-brain connectivity, the latter using a recently-developed connectome-wide association study approach as well as independent component and dual-regression analyses. In pursuit of understanding the heterogeneity across individuals with copy number variation in the Williams Syndrome genomic region, we have embarked on studies of the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the remaining or duplicated strand of the region.  We have developed novel methods to achieve specialized genotyping from SNP-chip data and applied these methods in proof-of-concept work testing the hypothesis that common variation in the ELN gene and not other 7q11.23 genes would predict clinically meaningful abnormalities of aortic structure.  We were able to generate haploid and triploid calls across the affected region and identified a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with aortic stenosis in WS participants and protection from aortic dilation in Dup7 participants (Gregory et al, 2018).  Ongoing work will focus on understanding how sequence variation within the WS region predisposes to variability in neural phenotypes, such as above-mentioned macrostructural characteristics that we have observed to be associated with 7q11.23 copy number variation in a gene-dose dependent manner.  Additionally, because 7q11.23 copy number variation is thought to play a role in hominid speciation, we are assessing WS genes in light of recent findings of archaic DNA effects (Gregory et al, 2017). Preliminary data from our WS developmental cohort has already demonstrated parietal hypofunction during visuospatial challenge and altered social network activation during processing of socially salient stimuli, consistent with the hypothesis that both visuospatial and social neurobiological differences in WS are rooted in early life. This project seeks not only to expand knowledge of the WS-related brain systems in childhood, but also to identify developmental trajectory (throughout childhood) and gene dose-response characteristics of neural abnormalities underlying visuospatial and socio-emotional alterations in this syndrome using a longitudinal, repeated measures design. Though data accrual will require years of careful and concerted effort to complete, the potential for these studies to shed unprecedented light on genetic contributions to brain development is enormous.

Affective disorders are highly prevalent sources of morbidity and mortality, shortening life span by a decade or more, accounting for over $200 billion annually in direct and indirect costs in the US, and representing a leading source of disease burden worldwide. Our studies focus on affective disorders distinguished by their appearance during periods of reproductive endocrine change (i.e., reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders RERMDs). These disorders are prevalent and accompanied by considerable morbidity. Postpartum depression occurs after approximately 15% of deliveries (and, therefore, approximately 300,000 to 500,000 US women are at risk each year), it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with childbirth, and it has deleterious effects on infants, including poor health and lower cognitive function. Similarly, a recent publication of the 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) ranks premenstrual syndrome and major depression as the 26th and 30th (respectively) of the 59 most prevalent chronic disorders worldwide. Unlike depressive illness accompanying endocrinopathies (e.g., hypothyroidism), RERMDs have been shown in our prior work to represent a differential sensitivity to an otherwise normal reproductive endocrine stimulus. Thus, RERMDs offer a unique opportunity to identify underlying mechanisms of affective dysregulation: i.e., we can demonstrate that a change in steroid level precipitates symptoms in women at risk, but the underlying susceptibility that transforms a normal endocrine signal into an abnormal behavioral response is as yet undetermined.In our studies of women with RERMDs our objectives are threefold: First, to identify the nature of the hormonal triggers in each of these mood disorders (i.e., premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMDD, perimenopause-related depression PMD, and postpartum depression PPD); Second, to characterize the physiologic systems (e.g., brain networks) targeted by ovarian steroids, changes in which could accompany symptoms in these conditions; Third, to identify the underlying substrates that contribute to the differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids that we demonstrate in women with these disorders. We employ naturalistic study designs in which we examine the effects of sex steroids on brain function and behavior during natural hormone transitions (i.e., across the menstrual cycle, during the puerperium, and during the perimenopause). We also employ experimental paradigms using hormone receptor agonists and antagonists, in which we recapitulate or block critical reproductive events in the natural hormone transition. The hormone manipulation studies also serve to confirm the presence and absence of ovarian steroid-sensitive behavioral phenotypes in the women who participate in our studies and in whom we perform functional genomic studies to investigate cellular substrates of risk in these conditions. Finally, our investigations of the determinants of behavioral sensitivity to ovarian steroids have directed our attention to the pubertal transition, a developmental stage when hormone sensitivity could be programmed (see ZIAMH002933-06).

This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00005011, NCT00056901, NCT00059228, NCT00082043, NCT00100360, NCT00001177, NCT00001259, and NCT00001481.The linkage between the onset of symptoms and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle suggests a role for ovarian steroid secretion in the pathophysiology of PMDD. Our studies have documented that PMDD symptoms are eliminated by ovarian suppression and stimulated by administration of ovarian steroids, yet appear in the context of levels of ovarian steroids indistinguishable from those in women without PMDD. We have recently more clearly defined the kinetics of the ovarian steroid event relevant to triggering PMDD symptoms. Women with PMDD who responded to treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-induced ovarian suppression (i.e., PMDD symptom remission) then were exposed to three months of combined continuous estradiol and progesterone treatment (E/P). We demonstrated that the change in levels of E/P from low to high, and not the steady state levels, was associated with the onset of PMDD symptoms. Although the mechanisms underlying the mood destabilizing effects of ovarian steroids in PMDD remain to be better characterized, as does the source of susceptibility to this trigger, our findings provide a new target on which interventions could be focused (namely increasing neurosteroid levels from the follicular to the luteal phase). To that end, we completed a pilot study evaluating (under blinded conditions) the effects of inhibiting the production of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone (a derivative of progesterone that is implicated in the alterations of neurotransmitter function that could lead to PMDD). After successful elimination of the luteal phase increase in allopregnanolone (despite maintaining normal progesterone levels), the emergence of luteal phase affective symptoms in PMDD were prevented. These findings have led to our plans to conduct a larger placebo-controlled treatment trial investigating the effects of stabilizing neurosteroid levels in women with PMDD. Our findings to date suggest that women with PMDD have a differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids (as demonstrated in our GnRH agonist studies) and the relevance of neural differences in the response to ovarian steroids with consequent differential activation (described above) of brain networks that mediate the affective responsivity of women with PMDD. These data set the stage for the performance of in vitro cellular studies of ovarian steroid responsivity in women with PMDD. The observed differential sensitivity could be due to an as yet unrecognized aspect of hormonal signaling or a difference in cellular response. Isolating the molecular mechanism of the observed differential response is key to interventional approaches and, therefore, we have moved to cellular models in which the molecular machinery of response (i.e., ovarian steroid receptors) is present. In collaboration with Dr. David Goldman at NIAAA, we developed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and human induced-pluripotent cell lines (h-IPSCs) from women with and without PMDD who have participated in our GnRH agonist-induced ovarian suppression studies. The behavioral outcomes observed during these protocols serve to refine the hormone-sensitive phenotype beyond simply the established clinical diagnoses. Women are selected retrospectively, based on the observed behavioral response to the hormone manipulation (i.e., occurrence of mood symptoms proximate to hormone manipulation in women with PMDD, or no changes in mood in the matched controls). Our in vitro experimental strategies attempt to recapitulate the endocrine events that trigger mood symptoms in women with PMDD.In this study, we found mRNA expression for estrogen receptor (ER) ESR1 (ERalpha) and ESR2 (ERbeta) and the progesterone membrane receptors PGRMC1 & 2. In untreated LCLs, our results overall suggest a divergence between mRNA and protein for the same genes. Pathway analyses of the LCL transcriptome revealed, among others, over-expression of ESC/E(Z) complex genes (an ovarian steroid-regulated gene silencing complex) in untreated LCLs from women with PMDD, with more than half of these genes over-expressed as compared to controls. This pattern of increased ESC/E(Z) mRNA expression was confirmed in the larger replication cohort by qRT-PCR. In contrast, protein expression of ESC/E(Z) genes was decreased in untreated PMDD LCLs. Finally, mRNA expression of several ESC/E(Z) complex genes were increased by P in controls only and decreased by E in PMDD LCLs. Our findings provide the first evidence of a plausible biological substrate for the differential behavioral response to E/P in women with PMDD. Indeed, these data suggest that women with PMDD have an intrinsic abnormality in their epigenetic capacity that could manifest in an alteration in their ability to translate environmental events into long-term changes in gene expression. Several issues require future exploration: First, preliminary evidence from a whole small RNA sequencing (targeting micro-RNA expression) shows a significantly increased expression of several micro-RNAs in LCLs from women with PMDD compared to those in controls. Additionally, several of these differentially expressed micro-RNAs target the ESC/E(Z) pathway, and, therefore, could contribute to the observed dissociation between increased expression of the ESC/E(Z) pathway genes and decreased protein levels of this same pathway in PMDD. Second, we have strengthened evidence of the physiologic relevance of the observed changes in ESC/E(Z) pathway genes in LCLs by demonstrating both baseline (untreated) expression of ESC/E(Z) pathway genes and the hormone stimulated effects on gene expression in both neuroprogenitor cell lines (derived from h-IPSCs developed from these same women) and in stock neuronal cell cultures. Finally, in a data-driven re-analysis of the untreated and estradiol-stimulated whole transcriptome sequencing, we identified a pattern of differential gene expression in several genes involved in the regulation of intra-cellular calcium signaling in women with PMDD compared to control women. We are pursuing these latter findings in LCLs with both a calcium stress challenge paradigm and intra-cellular calcium imaging studies. Finally, we have initiated a new collaborative initiative (supported by an NIH Bench to Bedside award), to employ these same methods to cell lines obtained from women with and without postpartum depression (PPD) and in women with first-onset postpartum psychosis.Lastly, we examined the possibility that women with PMDD metabolize steroids differently than asymptomatic controls and, therefore, produce a different profile of neuroactive steroid metabolites that contributes to the onset of PMDD symptoms. Pharmacometabolomic studies (employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy) were performed in women with PMDD who respond to Lupron with elimination of symptoms and who experience return of symptoms during progesterone (P) or estradiol (E) replacement, as well as controls who experience no change in mood during the identical experimental paradigm. Importantly, no differences in the formation of P-derived neurosteroids were observed in this sample of women studied under controlled hormone. However, despite identical exposures to E and P, women with PMDD were distinguished by differences in their profiles of sulfated steroid metabolites. Relative to the Lupron condition (i.e., suppressed steroid secretion), women with PMDD were distinguished from controls by a significantly attenuated sulfotransferase activity which also could contribute to the differential steroid sensitivity in PMDD.

Affective disorders are highly prevalent sources of morbidity and mortality, shortening life span by a decade or more, accounting for over $200 billion annually in direct and indirect costs in the US, and representing a leading source of disease burden worldwide. Our studies focus on affective disorders distinguished by their appearance during periods of reproductive endocrine change (i.e., reproductive endocrine-related mood disorders RERMDs). These disorders are prevalent and accompanied by considerable morbidity. Postpartum depression occurs after approximately 15% of deliveries (and, therefore, approximately 300,000 to 500,000 US women are at risk each year), it is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality associated with childbirth, and it has deleterious effects on infants, including poor health and lower cognitive function. Similarly, a recent publication of the 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) ranks premenstrual syndrome and major depression as the 26th and 30th (respectively) of the 59 most prevalent chronic disorders worldwide. Unlike depressive illness accompanying endocrinopathies (e.g., hypothyroidism), RERMDs have been shown in our prior work to represent a differential sensitivity to an otherwise normal reproductive endocrine stimulus. Thus, RERMDs offer a unique opportunity to identify underlying mechanisms of affective dysregulation: i.e., we can demonstrate that a change in steroid level precipitates symptoms in women at risk, but the underlying susceptibility that transforms a normal endocrine signal into an abnormal behavioral response is as yet undetermined.In our studies of women with RERMDs our objectives are threefold: First, to identify the nature of the hormonal triggers in each of these mood disorders (i.e., premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMDD, perimenopause-related depression PMD, and postpartum depression PPD); Second, to characterize the physiologic systems (e.g., brain networks) targeted by ovarian steroids, changes in which could accompany symptoms in these conditions; Third, to identify the underlying substrates that contribute to the differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids that we demonstrate in women with these disorders. We employ naturalistic study designs in which we examine the effects of sex steroids on brain function and behavior during natural hormone transitions (i.e., across the menstrual cycle, during the puerperium, and during the perimenopause). We also employ experimental paradigms using hormone receptor agonists and antagonists, in which we recapitulate or block critical reproductive events in the natural hormone transition. The hormone manipulation studies also serve to confirm the presence and absence of ovarian steroid-sensitive behavioral phenotypes in the women who participate in our studies and in whom we perform functional genomic studies to investigate cellular substrates of risk in these conditions. Finally, our investigations of the determinants of behavioral sensitivity to ovarian steroids have directed our attention to the pubertal transition, a developmental stage when hormone sensitivity could be programmed (see ZIAMH002933-06).

Several of the neurophysiologic systems involved in affective regulation and stress adaptation are regulated by ovarian steroids; however, less is known about those systems that underlie the differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids observed in women with Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). Our approach has been as follows: First, to examine how ovarian steroids modulate neurocircuitry in asymptomatic control women; Second, to evaluate the neuroregulatory impact of interactions between ovarian steroids and common functional variants  in specific genes in which there is biological evidence that the gene expression is both regulated by ovarian steroids (e.g., BDNF) and impacts  CNS function; Finally, to determine whether the effects of ovarian steroids on neural circuitry differ in women with PMDD. In our gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist studies, we have been able to examine directly the effects on brain activation of acute hypogonadism and individual ovarian steroid replacement in women employing both oxygen-15 water (H215O) PET and functional MRI (fMRI) (i.e., both PET and fMRI scans are performed during each of the three hormone conditions i.e., hypogonadism and two replacement conditions). Ultimately, to understand the influence of ovarian steroids on affective regulation, these effects must be studied at a circuit level of modulation. Consequently, we have explored the impact of ovarian steroid availability and withdrawal on regional brain activation and functional connectivity. In collaboration with Dr. Karen Berman, we previously observed significant effects of GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism, estradiol and progesterone on Wisconsin Card Sort-related regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus. This was the first demonstration in humans that ovarian steroids affect rCBF during cognitive stimulation. Similar findings were later reported by Shaywitz et al. in older postmenopausal women and are consistent with those in lower animals in which important interactions have been documented between the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and stress adaptation, as well as the modulatory effects of ovarian steroids on these systems.We have pursued our original findings by augmenting H215O PET imaging with fMRI. Each technique has advantages for this work, and conjointly they can provide important converging and complementary data. In both our PET and fMRI studies we examine several measures of brain function including resting state activity, cognitive and affective activational paradigms, and functional connectivity to investigate circuit level functions. We employ several different activation paradigms during the neuroimaging procedures, which allows us to test neural circuits relevant to the phenomenology of affective disorders (i.e., reward system, default mode network).The specific goals for this project include the following: 1) Examine the effects of ovarian steroids (or their neurosteroid metabolites) on measures of behavior, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function, and regional cerebral blood flow. 2) Determine the effects of sex steroids on the prefrontal reward systems, serotonin transporter function, and on those brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders (i.e., prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus). 3) Investigate the role of sex steroids in sex differences in cognitive test performance. 4) to examine gene expression in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and controls in cell lines to better understand the cellular basis of the differential behavior response to ovarian steroids.

","The Neuroregulatory Effects of Gonadal Steroids in Humans

This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00026832, NCT00100360, NCT00001177, and NCT00001322.Previous studies have identified the presence of abnormalities in resting state activity and reward processing in mood disorders. Indeed, altered resting state function represents an intriguing possible explanation for the generation of ovarian hormone-related state changes characterized by predictable alterations in social, cognitive (e.g., autobiographical memory), and affective function in women with PMDD. Results from our resting state H215O PET studies in healthy premenopausal women (n = 40) demonstrate effects of both hypogonadism and ovarian steroids on resting rCBF in several brain regions, including BA25, insula, and medial PFC (mPFC). Evidence also suggests that genomic variation in sex-steroid receptors or in the systems regulated by sex steroids may contribute to the ovarian hormone-sensitivity observed in PMDD. Thus, as a first step, we examined the effects of common allelic variations in women during each of the hormonal conditions established within the GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism and ovarian steroid addback protocol. As a first pass, we have tested specific, common polymorphisms (BDNF Val66Met and COMT Val158Met) that are molecularly functional, regulated by sex steroids and that are known to alter brain function, affect and cognition. In these studies, therefore, we employ these polymorphisms as probes for the involvement of these genes and the molecules they modulate in ovarian steroid behavioral/cognitive sensitivity.First, we examined the interaction between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and ovarian hormones on PET measurements of rCBF and fMRI BOLD signal while women performed a well-established working memory (WM) task (i.e. the n-back). Preclinical studies have documented multiple sites of interaction between estradiol and BDNF: estradiol increases BDNF function by binding to a putative estrogen response element (ERE) on the BDNF gene and/or by inducing the BDNF receptor, TrkB, and estradiol and BDNF activate similar signaling cascades and pathways through estrogen receptors and TrkB; respectively. Additionally, both BDNF and estradiol alone facilitate neural activity in the hippocampus and conjointly influence neural growth, survival, and plasticity in the hippocampus. In contrast, the BDNF Met protein has been shown to impair intracellular processing and activity-dependent modulation of BDNF in transfected hippocampal neuronal cultures. Finally, the humanized BDNF mouse displays atypical estrous cycle-related variations in both anxiety-like behaviors (i.e., open field, elevated-plus maze) and object placement memory compared with wild type mice. Moreover, these ovarian steroid-regulated behaviors in the humanized mouse are accompanied by alterations in hippocampal plasticity, relevant to both our understanding of behavioral sensitivity to ovarian steroids and stress-related disorders.We focused on neural recruitment in the DLPFC and hippocampus. In addition to the well-established n-back activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during WM, there is also a well-documented de-activation of the hippocampus observed in healthy controls at higher cognitive loads (possibly reflecting an uncoupling of hippocampal input to optimize prefrontal involvement in the increasing working memory load). For the PET analyses, 29 women were Val homozygotes and 10 were Met carriers; for the fMRI analysis there were 20 Val homozygotes and seven Met carriers. Participants were matched across genotypes for age, racial distribution, and handedness. Additionally, neither genotype nor hormone effects were observed in either depressive symptom ratings or working memory performance.In only Met carriers (i.e., women with the BDNF met allele in replace of the normal Val allele), the hippocampus was abnormally activated (not deactivated) during estradiol but not during the hypogonadal state or progesterone replacement. Separate analyses of the 0-back and 2-back indicate that these changes were due to neural activity during the working memory (2-back) condition and not the sensorimotor (0-back) control task. This study is the first in women to demonstrate a BDNF genotype by estradiol interaction on a cognitively-related neurophysiological response. These data suggest that the Met allele of the BDNF gene conveys an abnormal sensitivity to the presence of estradiol on hippocampal function, similar to that reported in the Met knock-in mice compared with wild type mice. In a companion collaboration with the Rockefeller University, we examine the effects of ovariectomy and estradiol replacement on both behavior and hippocampal gene expression in the female humanized BDNF heterozygous Met mouse. Preliminary data from these translational studies suggest that heterozygous Met mice show a differential behavioral sensitivity to estradiol in several hippocampal tasks and in anxiety-like behaviors. Preliminary data from whole transcriptome RNA sequencing in the BDNF heterozygous Met mouse (hippocampus) and in women with PMDD (lymphoblastoid cell lines) show a significant overlap in the expression of several gene networks stimulated by estradiol but a similar overlap in gene expression was observed with estradiol stimulation in neither wild type mice nor asymptomatic control women. This cross-species overlap in gene expression suggests the potential physiologic (and behavioral) relevance of the BDNF heterozygote met mouse to our understanding of PMDD. In a second study, we employed similar methods to examine the impact of the COMT Val158Met genotype on PET measured rCBF in the PFC. COMT plays an important role in the regulation of intra-synaptic dopamine levels in the PFC and also has a high affinity for the hydroxylated metabolites of estradiol/estrone (i.e., catecholestrogens). Moreover, the activity of COMT is reported to be both sexually dimorphic and modulated by estradiol (possibly by a putative ERE on the COMT gene in some human tissues). Consistent with a recent meta-analysis, whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed a significant COMT genotype by hormone interaction in the DLPFC, a finding that reflected estradiol-related changes in both Val and Met homozygotes. Specifically, the Met homozygotes (n = 11) showed an increase in DLPFC activation during estradiol compared with hypogonadism, whereas Val homozygotes (n = 11) showed the opposite pattern with lower activation during estradiol. DLPFC activation in heterozygotes (n = 13) was intermediate between the two homozygous groups. Significant effects of genotype were observed only during estradiol conditions, with Met homozygotes having significantly increased DLPFC activation compared with Val homozygotes. These data are consistent with observations that both COMT genotype and the presence or absence of estradiol influence dopaminergic function in the PFC. The mechanisms underlying this observation remain to be defined but are consistent with estradiol impacting PFC dopamine tuning through effects on DA synthesis and/or COMT enzyme activity, with attendant alterations in DLPFC efficiency.Overall, the findings from these studies demonstrate that in healthy women, variations in genes relevant to ovarian steroids can impact functional neurocircuitry and network level gene expression in regionally- and hormonally-specific ways here, specifically, interactions between BDNF and COMT genotypes and estradiol on the activation of functional neurocircuitry in the hippocampus (where BDNF is highly expressed) and the DLPFC (where COMT has primacy for dopamine trafficking), respectively. In studies currently underway, we will examine these gene-hormone interactions in reward-responsive and resting state neural circuits.

Preclinical studies have documented multiple sites of interaction between estradiol and BDNF: estradiol increases BDNF function by binding to a putative estrogen response element (ERE) on the BDNF gene and/or by inducing the BDNF receptor, TrkB, and estradiol and BDNF activate similar signaling cascades and pathways through estrogen receptors and TrkB; respectively. Additionally, both BDNF and estradiol alone facilitate neural activity in the hippocampus and conjointly influence neural growth, survival, and plasticity in the hippocampus. In contrast, the BDNF Met protein has been shown to impair intracellular processing and activity-dependent modulation of BDNF in transfected hippocampal neuronal cultures. Finally, the humanized BDNF mouse displays atypical estrous cycle-related variations in both anxiety-like behaviors (i.e., open field, elevated-plus maze) and object placement memory compared with wild type mice. Moreover, these ovarian steroid-regulated behaviors in the humanized mouse are accompanied by alterations in hippocampal plasticity, relevant to both our understanding of behavioral sensitivity to ovarian steroids and stress-related disorders.We focused on neural recruitment in the DLPFC and hippocampus. In addition to the well-established n-back activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during WM, there is also a well-documented de-activation of the hippocampus observed in healthy controls at higher cognitive loads (possibly reflecting an uncoupling of hippocampal input to optimize prefrontal involvement in the increasing working memory load). For the PET analyses, 29 women were Val homozygotes and 10 were Met carriers; for the fMRI analysis there were 20 Val homozygotes and seven Met carriers. Participants were matched across genotypes for age, racial distribution, and handedness. Additionally, neither genotype nor hormone effects were observed in either depressive symptom ratings or working memory performance.In only Met carriers (i.e., women with the BDNF met allele in replace of the normal Val allele), the hippocampus was abnormally activated (not deactivated) during estradiol but not during the hypogonadal state or progesterone replacement. Separate analyses of the 0-back and 2-back indicate that these changes were due to neural activity during the working memory (2-back) condition and not the sensorimotor (0-back) control task. This study is the first in women to demonstrate a BDNF genotype by estradiol interaction on a cognitively-related neurophysiological response. These data suggest that the Met allele of the BDNF gene conveys an abnormal sensitivity to the presence of estradiol on hippocampal function, similar to that reported in the Met knock-in mice compared with wild type mice. In a companion collaboration with the Rockefeller University, we examine the effects of ovariectomy and estradiol replacement on both behavior and hippocampal gene expression in the female humanized BDNF heterozygous Met mouse. Preliminary data from these translational studies suggest that heterozygous Met mice show a differential behavioral sensitivity to estradiol in several hippocampal tasks and in anxiety-like behaviors. Preliminary data from whole transcriptome RNA sequencing in the BDNF heterozygous Met mouse (hippocampus) and in women with PMDD (lymphoblastoid cell lines) show a significant overlap in the expression of several gene networks stimulated by estradiol but a similar overlap in gene expression was observed with estradiol stimulation in neither wild type mice nor asymptomatic control women. This cross-species overlap in gene expression suggests the potential physiologic (and behavioral) relevance of the BDNF heterozygote met mouse to our understanding of PMDD. In a second study, we employed similar methods to examine the impact of the COMT Val158Met genotype on PET measured rCBF in the PFC. COMT plays an important role in the regulation of intra-synaptic dopamine levels in the PFC and also has a high affinity for the hydroxylated metabolites of estradiol/estrone (i.e., catecholestrogens). Moreover, the activity of COMT is reported to be both sexually dimorphic and modulated by estradiol (possibly by a putative ERE on the COMT gene in some human tissues). Consistent with a recent meta-analysis, whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed a significant COMT genotype by hormone interaction in the DLPFC, a finding that reflected estradiol-related changes in both Val and Met homozygotes. Specifically, the Met homozygotes (n = 11) showed an increase in DLPFC activation during estradiol compared with hypogonadism, whereas Val homozygotes (n = 11) showed the opposite pattern with lower activation during estradiol. DLPFC activation in heterozygotes (n = 13) was intermediate between the two homozygous groups. Significant effects of genotype were observed only during estradiol conditions, with Met homozygotes having significantly increased DLPFC activation compared with Val homozygotes. These data are consistent with observations that both COMT genotype and the presence or absence of estradiol influence dopaminergic function in the PFC. The mechanisms underlying this observation remain to be defined but are consistent with estradiol impacting PFC dopamine tuning through effects on DA synthesis and/or COMT enzyme activity, with attendant alterations in DLPFC efficiency.Overall, the findings from these studies demonstrate that in healthy women, variations in genes relevant to ovarian steroids can impact functional neurocircuitry and network level gene expression in regionally- and hormonally-specific ways here, specifically, interactions between BDNF and COMT genotypes and estradiol on the activation of functional neurocircuitry in the hippocampus (where BDNF is highly expressed) and the DLPFC (where COMT has primacy for dopamine trafficking), respectively. In studies currently underway, we will examine these gene-hormone interactions in reward-responsive and resting state neural circuits.

Synapses are specialized contact sites between neurons where information is transmitted. Synapses are assembled between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons during early brain development. They are rearranged to optimize the connectivity of neural circuits during brain maturation, and are modulated in strength, size and number by experience during cognitive, emotional and behavioral processes. The ability of a synapse to change its structure and function is called synaptic plasticity, which is critical for proper brain development and function. Many mental disorders, including schizophrenia, autism, depression, and anxiety disorders are believed to stem from synaptic dysfunction during brain development and/or following adverse experience. The goal of this project is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and synapse development, to gain insights into the mechanisms of synaptic pathology associated with mental disorders, and to facilitate the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies for mental illnesses. The objective of this project during the current reporting period is to delineate the mechanisms by which autophagy regulates AMPA receptor recycling during long-term synaptic depression.

1. The molecular mechanism underlying long-term synaptic depression. The strength of synaptic transmission can change through synaptic plasticity. Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity (such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression of synaptic transmission) are important cellular mechanisms underlying information storage in the brain and the establishment of proper neural circuits during development. In this project, we investigated the mechanism underlying the induction of long-term depression of synaptic transmission (LTD). Our group has found  that macroautophagy(autophagy hereinafter) plays an important role in LTD. Autophagy is a cellular process which mediates the degradation of cytoplasmic components and organelles via lysosomes. . Autophagy is also essential for the development and function of synapses. It enables developmental pruning of dendritic spines (subcellular structures accommodating postsynaptic components), and regulates presynaptic structure, dopamine release, and degradation of postsynaptic receptors. Anomalous autophagy is associated with brain disorders.Autophagy is orchestrated by more than 30 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins and multiple signaling pathways. Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is the best-characterized regulator of autophagy induction in mammalian cells. Using mTOR inhibitors and knockout mice with deficient autophagy, we previously found that autophagic flux changes during LTD and this in turn leads to AMPA receptor endocytosis. During this reporting period, we investigated the mechanism by which autophagy regulates AMPA receptor internalization. We also examined the effect of altering autophagy on the behavior of mice. 2. The role of dysbindin-1 in synaptic physiology. Dysbindin-1 is a coiled-coil domain containing protein, initially discovered as a dystrophin-binding protein and later found to be one of eight subunits of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). The postmortem brains of individuals with schizophrenia consistently exhibit low levels of dysbindin-1 proteins and mRNAs. Our earlier work shows that dysbindin-1 contributes to the establishment of neuronal connectivity by regulating the growth of dendritic protrusions, including dendritic spines (tiny dendritic protrusions where excitatory synapses are formed) and filopodia (long, thin protrusions that serve as precursors of dendritic spines in young neurons). Dysbindin-1, therefore, may confer the risk for schizophrenia by regulating the development of dendritic spines. During this review period, we investigated the role of dysbindin-1 in psychogenic stress-induced synaptic alterations. We found that synaptic plasticity is more sensitive to psychogenic stress in dysbindin-1 mutant mice than in wild-type mice. Mild stress does not significantly affect synaptic plasticity in wild-type mice but alters social behavior in dysbindin-1 mutant mice. We recorded in the brain slice of stressed mice and found that stress alters synaptic physiology in mutant but not in wild-type mice. During this reporting period, we investigated the mechanism underlying this phenomenon and focused on determining the type of neurotransmitter receptors involved in psychogenic stress-induced synaptic alterations.

Brain development is profoundly influenced by gene expression, which is dynamically regulated across the lifespan. The temporal dynamics of gene expression is conferred by extensive transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. It is increasingly recognized that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression during brain development. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that primarily repress gene expression by destabilizing mRNAs or inhibiting translation. miRNAs function in differentiation, development and plasticity of neurons. miRNA expression in the brain is developmentally regulated and correlates with cortical maturation. Dysregulation of miRNA expression is detrimental to the brain. For instance, miRNA deficiency in mice causes aberrant synaptic protein expression, synaptic transmission, dendritic spines, learning and memory. miRNAs have been implicated in schizophrenia. Mutations in genes encoding miRNAs or components in the miRNA biogenesis machinery are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. miRNA expression is altered in the brains of schizophrenia patients. In our earlier study, we compared the expression of miRNAs in the postmortem brains of participants with and without schizophrenia. We identified miRNAs that are altered in the brains of participants with schizophrenia. The current objective of this project is to investigate the function of these miRNAs in neural development and synaptic physiology.

Using microarray and quantitative PCR, several groups have examined miRNA expression in postmortem brains of people with schizophrenia, and consistently detected miRNA expression change.

In this project, we employed the next-generation sequencing technology which offers superior sensitivity and quantifiability to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in schizophrenic brains. We also analyzed the effect of psychiatric medications and tobacco smoking on miRNA expression. Using bioinformatics, we found that the targets of miRNAs differentially expressed in schizophrenia are enriched for genes encoding synaptic proteins and those associated with risk for schizophrenia. During this reporting period, we selected a couple of miRNAs altered in people with schizophrenia and expressed them in the prefrontal cortex of mice. We analyzed dendritic spines and behavior in these mice.  We also established cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and differentiated them into neurons.

Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial frontal cortex (MFC) and the amygdala have been consistently implicated in several mental health disorders, including mood and anxiety disorders, panic attack syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). Current theory holds that these parts of the brain process the feedback that results from decisions, and that the brain uses this feedback to improve future decisions. The OFC, MFC and amygdala also play a key role in emotional and autonomic responses and in the recognition of emotions in other people. Accordingly, to achieve the goal of understanding mental health disorders at the level of brain mechanisms, we seek to understand how the OFC, MFC and amygdala process feedback, produce decisions, and generate both autonomic and emotional responses. Achievement of this overarching goal requires a combination of neurophysiological and neuropsychological methods. The specific objectives of this project are therefore: (1) to delineate how neurons in the OFC and MFC signal changes in expected feedback; (2) to study the neurophysiological interaction between the amygdala and both the OFC and MFC as subjects make decisions based on predicted feedback; (3) to examine the role of the amygdala, OFC and MFC in producing emotional responses in anticipation of and in reaction to feedback.

","Neural mechanisms of reward processing and emotion


","Section on Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, NIMH","
Measures of the autonomic nervous system are often used to infer mood or temporally extended affective states in humans, yet little is known about this relationship in other animals. Studies in animals have predominantly assessed instantaneous and short-lived behavioral and neural responses to either brief aversive or positive stimuli. No studies in nonhuman animals have probed the relationship between autonomic activity and temporally extended affective states that extend over minutes or hours, durations typical of mood states in humans. To address this issue, we analyzed EKG signals recorded from three animals while they performed a two-alternative forced-choice task for fluid reward. On each trial, animals chose between images that led to the delivery of different amounts of fluid. Importantly, the amount of fluid reward varied within each session as the amount of reward available on each trial was randomly selected. This meant that subjects experienced periods of high and low reward intake, which we predicted would modulate their affective state. To test this possibility, we examined the relationship between changes in reward rate over the course of each session and the subjects instantaneous heart rate over different time scales (10-60 seconds). For all three subjects, there was a consistent negative correlation between heart rate and reward rate. This effect was not driven by changes in breathing as a result of reward consumption and was statistically significant in a high proportion of sessions (p<0.01). Thus, our data suggest that heart rate may reflect a temporally extended affective state in nonhuman animals.Tastes and their associated values drive food consumption and influence choice behavior. To understand the neural mechanisms underlying reward-guided decision making and value learning, we characterized the gustatory system in subjects with fMRI while measuring licking to control for oral movements, and to assess preferences. To identify taste-responsive cortex, we delivered small quantities of sucrose, citric acid, or distilled water in random order without any predictive cues (e.g., visual stimuli) to subjects while using event-related fMRI. In addition, we used an MRI-compatible lick sensor to measure subjects licking during the scans. fMRI signals associated with licking in the absence of fluid delivery were used to mask responses to fluid delivery/receipt and associated licking. Licking in the absence of fluid delivery and fluid receipt times for each tastant were incorporated into a general linear model to analyze fMRI data. By contrasting BOLD responses to sweet and sour tastes with those from distilled water, we identified taste responses in primary gustatory cortex area G, an adjacent portion of the anterior insular cortex, and area 12o. Choice tests run outside the scanner revealed that all three subjects strongly preferred sucrose over citric acid or water. BOLD responses in the ventral striatum and amygdala reflected subjects preferences, with greater BOLD responses to sucrose than citric acid. Finally, we examined the influence of hydration level by contrasting BOLD responses to receipt of fluids when animals were thirsty and after ad libitum water consumption. BOLD responses in area G and area 12o in the left hemisphere were greater following full hydration, which may reflect an influence of internal state on taste processing. By contrast, BOLD responses in portions of medial frontal cortex were reduced after ad libitum water consumption. Thus, activation in this region, which is implicated in value-based decision making, is modulated by internal state. These findings highlight brain regions involved in representing taste, taste preference and internal state.

Clinical studies have repeatedly implicated the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the medial prefrontal cortex (MFC) and the amygdala in phobias, panic attacks, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Patients with major depressive disorder, for example, show altered cerebral blood flow in all three of these brain structures. Furthermore, dysfunctional interactions of the OFC and the MFC with the amygdala are thought to underlie these disorders, at least in part.Much of our information about brain structure and function is derived from studies that employ functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and either molecular or genetic methodologies. The results that these methods provide are correlational in nature, not causal, and therefore can establish structure-function relationships in only a provisional way. The lack of a causal analysis hampers any attempt to translate research findings into improvements in a patients quality of life. In the absence of causal knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology, and especially about the localization of functions disrupted in mental health disorders, treatments of these diseases typically affect the whole brain. Targeted interventions, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), when they have been attempted at all, have lacked a strong theoretical foundation. A better understanding of the structural underpinnings of emotion and valuation is therefore essential for progress in this area.Given the links between mental health disorders and altered function in the OFC, MFC, and the amygdala, there is a clear need for an improved understanding of their role in learning, decision making, and emotion in both health and disease.The overarching goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the functional interactions among the amygdala, the OFC and the MFC in value-based decision making. Accordingly, our work examines the specific and collective contributions of these three key components of the limbic system to reward and emotion. The specific objectives of this project are: (1) to elucidate the role of the amygdala, the OFC and the MFC in reward processing, valuation and emotion; (2) to understand the selective contributions of the OFC and the MFC to value-based decision making; and (3) to explore therapies that might ameliorate the symptoms of major depressive disorder and other disorders of mood and anxiety.

","Neural Substrates of Reward Processing and Emotion


","Section on Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, NIMH","
Neurons in the OFC encode the sensory properties, magnitude and subjective value of expected and received outcomes, typically foods and fluids. For this reason, OFC has been studied for it role in learning and reward-based choice. The estimated values of choices, and therefore decision making based on those values, is influenced by both the chance that the chosen items or goods can be obtained (availability) and their current worth (desirability).  OFC is thought to be essential for both these aspects of stimulus-reward learning. Yet the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a region adjacent to OFC, has also been implicated in learning about the availability of outcomes. To explore the functional specializations of these two frontal cortex regions, we trained animals on two tasks: one required updating representations of a predicted outcomes desirability, as measured by the devaluation task; the other required updating representations of an outcomes availability, as indexed by performance on a probabilistic 3-choice visual discrimination. We evaluated performance on both tasks in three groups of animals: unoperated controls and those with selective, fiber-sparing lesions of either OFC or VLPFC. We found that VLPFC but not OFC plays an essential role in making choices based on outcome availability; in contrast, OFC but not VLPFC is essential for making choices based on outcome desirability. Additional analyses indicated that VLPFC is essential for the ability to link particular outcomes with particular choices, a process sometimes called credit assignment. The separate processing of outcome availability and desirability in VLPFC and OFC, respectively, has implications for models of prefrontal cortex function during choice behavior.As indicated above, neurons in the OFC encode the sensory properties, magnitude and subjective value of expected and received rewarding outcomes. Subjective value is reflected not only in neural activity, but also in autonomic responses. Indeed, both neural activity and pupil diameter, a measure of sympathetic autonomic arousal, are correlated with the magnitude of expected reward. However, previous research has not identified whether the value coding in OFC is linked with autonomic arousal. To answer this question, we compared animals with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of OFC and unoperated controls on a reward magnitude task in which five visually presented images were assigned to five different fluid reward amounts (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 ml). Animals were required to maintain fixation at the center of a monitor screen for the duration of each trial, which consisted of image presentation (cue period), an unfilled interval with no cue (delay period), and reward delivery. Animals received the amount of reward assigned to the single image displayed on that trial. Pupil size served as our measure of autonomic arousal. We found that the two groups did not differ in their rate of acquisition of significant autonomic responses during the cue period. In addition, both groups exhibited a pupil size that was positively related to reward magnitude. Compared to the controls, however, animals with OFC lesions showed a late onset of differentiated pupillary responses during the cue period and a significant impairment in sustaining arousal during the delay period. At the same time, autonomic responses to unsignaled reward and to changes in luminance were intact, demonstrating that OFC lesions did not affect the basic physiology of the pupil. Our findings show that OFC is necessary for acquiring the normal pattern of autonomic arousal in anticipation of different reward magnitudes. In particular, the data suggest that subjective value representations in OFC sustain autonomic arousal for biologically significant events.For decades, it has been known that lesions of OFC and surrounding white matter produce blunted affective responses to threatening stimuli. Recent evidence involving restricted (excitotoxic, fiber-sparing) damage to OFC has shown contradictory effects of either no involvement of OFC or heightened affective responses, but these studies differ with respect to the species studied and the extent of OFC damage. To address these discrepancies and further examine the putative role of OFC in emotional regulation, we studied animals with restricted bilateral excitotoxic lesions targeting either lateral OFC or medial OFC. The performances of these groups and a group with total bilateral lesions of OFC were compared to that of a group of unoperated controls on defensive responses to the presentation of a rubber snake, rubber spider, and neutral objects for comparison. Both subtotal lesion groups showed heightened defensive responses as indexed by latency to retrieve a food reward in the presence of the spider and snake. Surprisingly, the group with medial OFC lesions showed greater food-retrieval latencies even in the presence of neutral objects, compared to unoperated controls. Our data indicate that medial and lateral OFC make dissociable contributions to emotional regulation. In addition, the findings strongly suggest that any emotional blunting associated with OFC damage is due to a disruption of fibers of passage (that is, fibers passing nearby OFC), as opposed to damage to cell bodies residing in OFC.  A considerable body of evidence suggests a role for the amygdala in processing emotionally salient information in faces. For example, patients with amygdala damage fix their gaze on the eye region of faces to a lesser extent than controls. In our earlier work we used an attentional capture task to assess the role of the amygdala in attending to different aspects of facial expressions of emotion.  In that study, and in most studies of face viewing, eye movements are monitored while face images are presented singly in the center of a monitor screen. If the amygdala plays a role in the prioritization of faces in natural viewing behavior, however, then the amygdala might be essential for guiding eye movements toward face images when they are competing with other images for attention. To test this possibility, we assessed the effects of bilateral amygdala damage on viewing preferences for faces, illusory faces, and non-face objects when two images were presented simultaneously, side by side.  We collected two dependent measures: how long a subject looked at each of the images in a given pair and where they fixated within each image. Unlike intact animals, who showed robust preferences for both real and illusory faces, animals with amygdala damage showed no preference for either real or illusory faces over non-face objects. Further, whereas intact animals showed classic face viewing patterns prioritizing discrete facial features, such as the eyes and mouth, animals with amygdala damage showed disorganized viewing patterns better described by models of perceptual salience. These results identify the amygdala as critical for our earliest specialized response to faces, a behavior thought to be a precursor for efficient social communication.

Clinical studies have repeatedly implicated the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the medial prefrontal cortex (MFC) and the amygdala in phobias, panic attacks, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Patients with major depressive disorder, for example, show altered cerebral blood flow in all three of these brain structures. Furthermore, dysfunctional interactions of the OFC and the MFC with the amygdala are thought to underlie these disorders, at least in part.Much of our information about brain structure and function is derived from studies that employ functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and either molecular or genetic methodologies. The results that these methods provide are correlational in nature, not causal, and therefore can establish structure-function relationships in only a provisional way. The lack of a causal analysis hampers any attempt to translate research findings into improvements in a patients quality of life. In the absence of causal knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology, and especially about the localization of functions disrupted in mental health disorders, treatments of these diseases typically affect the whole brain. Targeted interventions, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), when they have been attempted at all, have lacked a strong theoretical foundation. A better understanding of the structural underpinnings of emotion and valuation is therefore essential for progress in this area.Given the links between mental health disorders and altered function in the OFC, MFC, and the amygdala, there is a clear need for an improved understanding of their role in learning, decision making, and emotion in both health and disease.The overarching goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the functional interactions among the amygdala, the OFC and the MFC in value-based decision making. Accordingly, our work examines the specific and collective contributions of these three key components of the limbic system to reward and emotion. The specific objectives of this project are: (1) to elucidate the role of the amygdala, the OFC and the MFC in reward processing, valuation and emotion; (2) to understand the selective contributions of the OFC and the MFC to value-based decision making; and (3) to explore therapies that might ameliorate the symptoms of major depressive disorder and other disorders of mood and anxiety.

There are two major goals to our research on learning and plasticity. First, we aim to elucidate how neural processing in the brain changes during the course of learning or training to perform specific tasks or skills. Second, we are investigating how learning can be modulated (for example, through feedback) and establishing the brain mechanisms that underlie such effects. By combining these two goals we hope to provide insight into how learning and training may be used to ameliorate the effects of dysfunction in the nervous system. To achieve these goals we use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure both structure (gray matter, white matter) and function in the brain of participants performing specific tasks and compare those findings with behavioral measures of performance. Understanding the neural mechanisms of learning and the capacity for brain plasticity is vital for enhancing learning and for the development of rehabilitative therapies.

","Learning and plasticity in the human brain


","Section on Learning and Plasticity, NIMH","
The primary goals of this research are i) to establish how learning impacts the structure and function of the brain, and ii) to determine how learning can be modulated by factors such as feedback (positive or negative). Over the past year we have focused equally on both of these goals.1) Impact of learning on brain structure and function (NCT00001360)Over the past few years, we have been conducting a long-term longitudinal study of participants learning different tasks (e.g. motor sequences, spatial layout) to determine how structural properties of the brain (gray matter, white matter) change over time. Over a period of four weeks, participants were trained in two different tasks and we collected extensive functional and structural MRI data over the course of training. While previous studies have identified structural changes associated with learning, even over the course of a couple of hours, our initial findings have highlighted a potential confound that needs to be accounted for in such studies. Specifically, we have found that the structural and functional measures obtained with MRI fluctuate according to the time of day. Structurally, we observed decreases in cortical thickness and increases in ventricular volume as well as increases in free water volume fraction that is associated with an increase in cerebrospinal fluid. Functionally, we observed changes in resting state connectivity in the same regions where we saw structural changes. Collectively, these results suggest that the diurnal fluctuations  in MRI measures that we detected have an underlying physiological basis and may reflect the impact of the circadian rhythm.Interestingly, these fluctuation appear to be modulated by training and we are trying to establish what additional structural and functional changes occur with training above and beyond these time-of-day effects. With the motor sequence task we find that, following training, sensorimotor networks show changes in their functional connectivity. In contrast, with the spatial layout task, hippocampal networks change. These findings suggest task-specific changes in particular networks underlie learning above and beyond any changes due to circadian fluctuations.2) Impact of feedback on learning (NCT00001360)We are investigating the impact of feedback (positive, negative) on motor learning. Groups of participants were trained on one of two different motor tasks and either provided with positive, negative or neutral (uninformative) feedback. Training occurred in the MRI scanner and we measured fMRI activity before, during and after training. Behaviorally, we found that the impact of feedback is dependent on the task. While in a sequence learning task we find that punishment improves online performance, we observe the opposite effect in a purely motoric force-tracking task.In terms of brain activity, we found that reward and punishment differentially affected the functional connectivity of premotor cortex (PMC, a region known to be critical for learning of sequencing skills) in a task-specific manner. For a serial reaction time task (pushing a sequence of buttons in response to visual cues), training with reward increased PMC connectivity with cerebellum and striatum, while training with punishment increased PMC-medial temporal lobe connectivity. For a force tracking task (sqeezing a bar to control the movement of a cursor on the screen), training with control and reward increased PMC connectivity with parietal and temporal cortices after training, while training with punishment increased PMC connectivity with ventral striatum. These findings suggest that reward and punishment influence spontaneous brain activity after training, and that the regions implicated depend on the task learned.Establishing the nature, degree and consequences of plasticity in the adult cortex provides important insights into the potential for rehabilitative brain therapies following injury or dysfunction in the nervous system.

Clinicians and researchers now routinely peer inside the human brain to assess the neural mechanisms of cognitive function.  This remarkable technological achievement, greatly advanced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has changed our relationship with our own brains and is slowly starting to transform the way we think about psychiatric and neurological disorders. The fMRI method is not a direct measure of neural activity;  instead, it is a method that maps the regional regulation of blood flow within the brain. Because blood flow is largely coupled to regional changes in neural activity, this surrogate signal works surprisingly well as a measure of brain function. For basic research, fMRI offers an inherent trade-off compared to other methods, such as electrophysiological recordings. Its capacity to measure spatially localized responses throughout the brain of awake humans is unmatched by other methods. However, these advantages are tempered by the fact that it is only an indirect measure of neural activity. In our group, we are currently using three approaches to elucidate the nature of fMRI mapping and its relationship to underlying neural activity. The first approach studies how local blood flow responses relate to the diversity of signals among neurons packed densely within a small volume, such as a single MRI voxel. The second approach asks how spontaneous neural activity patterns from a single point in the brain relate to the well-described correlational networks commonly observed in fMRI studies of functional connectivity. The third approach involves the reversible inactivation of signals in neuromodulatory structures such as the basal forebrain, which have been suspected to play a prominent role in driving spontaneous fMRI activity. In our research program, we combine neural recordings and temporary inactivation with fMRI signals measured in paradigms ranging from resting wakefulness to complex cognitive tasks. Understanding how functional mapping can reflect neural activity patterns is important both for assessing neural activity in patients scanned using fMRI and for increasing our basic understanding of brain function.

","The Neural Basis of Functional MRI Responses


","Section on Cognitive Neurophysiology and Imaging, NIMH","
It is now commonplace to see maps of human brain activity created using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This method has greatly advanced our understanding of how activity in the brain corresponds to particular percepts, actions, and thoughts.  More recently, even the spontaneous activity in the brain  in the absence of any task or stimulus  has cast light on the functional organization of the brains intrinsic networks and operational principles. At its core, fMRI is a readout of local disturbances to an artificially induced magnetic field brought about by local changes in blood flow, which is in turn linked to neural activity.  Following the initial discovery of this functional MRI method more than two decades ago, it was not immediately obvious that neural activity and blood flow should so reliably coupled that the latter could act as a reliable surrogate signal for the former.  Now this coupling is nearly taken for granted. Yet blood flow and neural activity are clearly different, and this fact has continued to frustrate a generation of neuroscientists who have sought a convenient means of translating fMRI signals into neural terms.  Even in theory, this problem seems  and is  impossible:  how can one pinpoint a unique pattern of activity among millions of neurons that maps to a slow series of blood-based changes in image intensity within a volume of the brain?  Despite the inherently underdetermined nature of the problem, this is an important area of study simply because any clues can have wide-reaching consequences for interpreting experiments in humans. While our laboratory does not study neurovascular coupling per se, we do undertake experiments that bring new insights into the interpretation of the hemodynamic fMRI signal.  Our recent work in this area has focused on two points.  First, we are studying the nature of local neural diversity of in the spiking responses to different types of signals, and how this bears on the hemodynamic responses from the same voxel or area.  Second, we are investigating the relationship between activity in large-scale functional MRI networks across the brain to local neural activity measured at a single position.In one of the papers published in the last years (Park et al., Neuron 2017),  we discovered that neurons from within a single voxel were highly varied in their responses to naturalistic movies. Important from the perspective of the basis of the fMRI signal, we further found the local blood flow activity followed only a small proportion (16%) of 150 neurons tightly packed within a single voxel < 1mm3. The time courses of these special neurons closely matched both the local field potential (LFP) signal and the vascular response, suggesting that they may have a particular importance for local vascular control. This result may help explain why there is often a discrepancy between local spiking activity on the one hand and LFP and fMRI activity on the other, a point we have previously made in the laboratory (Maier et al. Nature Neuroscience 2008).   We are currently pursuing this research direction through the use of simultaneous single-unit recordings inside the MR scanner.  Over the years, we have developed and acquired many of the necessary components (MR-compatible electrodes and microdrive, suitable RF coils, preamplifiers, cables, and filters) to achieve such simultaneous recording.  With a new postdoc in the laboratory, we hope to understand the nature of such neural diversity under multiple conditions, including spontaneous activity and the free viewing of trial-unique natural videos.  Comparing single unit and field potential recordings with fMRI time courses under these conditions requires simultaneous data collection. The second area in which we have investigated the basis of the fMRI signal involves the manipulation of the basal forebrain, a small areas that projects broadly to the cerebral cortex.  In our first published paper on this, we examined the effects of reversibly inactivating the basal forebrain using pharmacological agents (Turchi, Chang, et al.,2018). Our initial experiments inactivated portions of this structure in animals undergoing fMRI testing.  They suggested that the basal forebrain is centrally involved in regulating spontaneous signals throughout the telencephalon, at least during rest.  This effect is particularly pronounced during transitions of arousal, gauged by eye opening and closure. Through collaboration (Liu X et al., manuscript under review), we have also found that the spontaneous signals in the human cerebral cortex are likely also driven by basal forebrain input. These studies paint a new picture of spontaneous brain activity that consists of two rather different components: the first global component is orchestrated regionally by the basal forebrain long-range projections, whereas the second local component is more strongly determined by other factors, including but not limited to anatomical projections.  At present, we are beginning a new study that will employ viral optogenetic methods in the macaque to perturb different basal forebrain subdivisions in monkeys at rest and during the performance of a range of behavioral tasks.  We also plan to record single unit activity from the basal forebrain wirelessly while the monkey is in its cage in order to establish long-term dynamics of activity within this small but influential area.

Clinicians and researchers now routinely peer inside the human brain to assess the neural mechanisms of cognitive function.  This remarkable technological achievement, greatly advanced by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has changed our relationship with our own brains and is slowly starting to transform the way we think about psychiatric and neurological disorders. The fMRI method is not a direct measure of neural activity;  instead, it is a method that maps the regional regulation of blood flow within the brain. Because blood flow is largely coupled to regional changes in neural activity, this surrogate signal works surprisingly well as a measure of brain function. For basic research, fMRI offers an inherent trade-off compared to other methods, such as electrophysiological recordings. Its capacity to measure spatially localized responses throughout the brain of awake humans is unmatched by other methods. However, these advantages are tempered by the fact that it is only an indirect measure of neural activity. In our group, we are currently using three approaches to elucidate the nature of fMRI mapping and its relationship to underlying neural activity. The first approach studies how local blood flow responses relate to the diversity of signals among neurons packed densely within a small volume, such as a single MRI voxel. The second approach asks how spontaneous neural activity patterns from a single point in the brain relate to the well-described correlational networks commonly observed in fMRI studies of functional connectivity. The third approach involves the reversible inactivation of signals in neuromodulatory structures such as the basal forebrain, which have been suspected to play a prominent role in driving spontaneous fMRI activity. In our research program, we combine neural recordings and temporary inactivation with fMRI signals measured in paradigms ranging from resting wakefulness to complex cognitive tasks. Understanding how functional mapping can reflect neural activity patterns is important both for assessing neural activity in patients scanned using fMRI and for increasing our basic understanding of brain function. 

It is now commonplace to see maps of human brain activity created using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This method has greatly advanced our understanding of how activity in the brain corresponds to particular percepts, actions, and thoughts.  More recently, even the spontaneous activity in the brain  in the absence of any task or stimulus  has cast light on the functional organization of the brains intrinsic networks and operational principles. At its core, fMRI is a readout of local disturbances to an artificially induced magnetic field brought about by local changes in blood flow, which is in turn linked to neural activity.  Following the initial discovery of this functional MRI method more than two decades ago, it was not immediately obvious that neural activity and blood flow should so reliably coupled that the latter could act as a reliable surrogate signal for the former.  Now this coupling is nearly taken for granted. Yet blood flow and neural activity are clearly different, and this fact has continued to frustrate a generation of neuroscientists who have sought a convenient means of translating fMRI signals into neural terms.  Even in theory, this problem seems  and is  impossible:  how can one pinpoint a unique pattern of activity among millions of neurons that maps to a slow series of blood-based changes in image intensity within a volume of the brain?  Despite the inherently underdetermined nature of the problem, this is an important area of study simply because any clues can have wide-reaching consequences for interpreting experiments in humans. While our laboratory does not study neurovascular coupling per se, we do undertake experiments that bring new insights into the interpretation of the hemodynamic fMRI signal.  Our recent work in this area has focused on two points.  First, we are studying the nature of local neural diversity of in the spiking responses to different types of signals, and how this bears on the hemodynamic responses from the same voxel or area.  Second, we are investigating the relationship between activity in large-scale functional MRI networks across the brain to local neural activity measured at a single position.In one of the papers published in the last years (Park et al., Neuron 2017),  we discovered that neurons from within a single voxel were highly varied in their responses to naturalistic movies. Important from the perspective of the basis of the fMRI signal, we further found the local blood flow activity followed only a small proportion (16%) of 150 neurons tightly packed within a single voxel < 1mm3. The time courses of these special neurons closely matched both the local field potential (LFP) signal and the vascular response, suggesting that they may have a particular importance for local vascular control.

It is the objective of the Unit on Neural Circuits and Adaptive Behaviors group, as part of the Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch, to understand the logic and mechanisms of experience-dependent cortical information processing at the molecular, cellular, circuitry and behavioral levels.  An integrated approach including molecular genetics, optical imaging, electrophysiology, neuromodulation and behavioral techniques are applied to investigate the ability of the brain to change in response to environmental challenges and social interactions across developmental stages.  Both normal mice and mice carrying genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction are the subjects of studies.To accomplish this goal, we are interested in engineering new tools and developing new approaches to monitor and modulate the cellular and molecular dynamics induced by neurobehavioral perturbations in mice.  Such tools will lead us to:1) Identify the molecular and cellular changes in the developing and adult brain that are regulated by internal drives, environmental exposures, and social interactions of an animal;2) Determine the neurophysiological consequences of these molecular and cellular changes and the mechanisms by which these changes are integrated in the cortical circuits to control behavioral decisions and action plans; and3) Elucidate the development of brain dysfunctions in real time and the effects of pharmacological, electroceutical, and behavioral treatments.

","Unit on Neural Circuits and Adaptive Behaviors, NIMH","
Our brain can be considered as a type of information processing system like a computer, where input signals need to be first detected and properly represented, then integrated with goals for decision-making and output control.  Executive control of goal-directed behaviors is frequently disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders.  The executive control function of the brain is achieved through complex circuits of neurons, which also interact closely with surrounding glial cells.  In order to understand the etiology and develop treatments for mental disorders, it is important to investigate the functional architecture of neuronal circuits and the mechanisms of neuron-glia interactions.We have chosen to use laboratory mice as a model organism to investigate the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of cortical information processing. This organism offers several major advantages for this line of study. First, mice and humans both have about 30,000 genes, and about 99 percent of them are shared. Second, the cellular organization of mouse cerebral cortex is similar to human, and major cortical regions are also homologous. Third, it is possible to perform precise molecular genetic manipulations in specific types of cells in mouse brain, which is required to establish causal relationships between genes, cells, circuits and behaviors. Corticospinal neurons (CSNs), which send direct projections from the cortex to the spinal cord, are the logical candidates to read out the effects of cortical cognitive and emotional regulation systems on goal-directed motor programs.  CSNs are scattered over multiple cortical regions such as secondary motor, primary motor and somatosensory cortex.  How CSNs from different cortical areas are organized functionally during goal-directed actions remains unknown.  We developed an innovative approach to specifically label and image the activity of large populations of CSNs with single-neuron resolution in freely moving mice that are trained to perform a goal-directed forelimb reach-and-grasp task, and obtained the first functional map of CSNs across the cortex.  Strikingly, this map shows a topographic segregation of CSNs that are activated at different movement steps across multiple cortical areas, suggesting that spatially defined groups of CSNs may encode different movement modules.  In collaboration with Dr. Zhigang Hes group at Boston Childrens Hospital, we showed that these region-specific CSNs terminate in different spinal locations, therefore preferentially controlling the premotor neurons of muscles engaged in different steps of the task.  Our study reveals a new organizing principle of corticospinal circuits for goal-directed motor skills.  It suggests that constructing a multistep goal-directed behavior may involve the recruitment of individual CSN groups in correct order, analogous to composing a sentence (behavior) by stringing together different words (CSN groups). The parallel and modular organization of corticospinal circuits may allow for the development of neural decoding strategies to detect changes in higher-order cortical functions versus subcortical abnormalities and build brain-machine interface-based interventions for brain disorders.  Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene.  Earlier studies of the etiology of this disease mostly focused on neuronal dysfunctions resulting from Mecp2 deletion in mice.  Recent research has suggested that astrocytes play an important role in the disease progression of Rett syndrome and loss of Mecp2 in astrocytes can cause neuronal defects non-cell autonomously.  However, the functional phenotypes and mechanisms within RTT astrocytes are not well understood.  In collaboration with Dr. Qiang Changs group at University of Wisconsin-Madison, we used in vivo two-photon imaging to demonstrate that the spontaneous calcium activity in RTT astrocytes is abnormal.  This abnormal activity is mediated by calcium overload in the endoplasmic reticulum through TRPC4 channel, which leads to excessive activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors on neighboring neurons and increased network excitability.  These findings provide evidence that abnormal calcium homeostasis is a key cell-autonomous phenotype in RTT astrocytes and reveal its mechanism and consequence.

Humans and other primates have large brains replete with circuitry dedicated to social perception and action.  In the domain of vision, primates engage in highly complex social signaling. Their brains are obviously specialized for this purpose, with multiple cortical areas dedicated to the processing of faces, bodies, and conspecific sounds, and to the production of facial expressions and vocalizations.  At the single neuron level, the social fluency of primates is reflected in the tuning of spiking responses to facial identity, expressions, bodily postures, and social contexts. These responses are clearly driven by genetic predisposition, since both human and monkey infants from their first days of life show interest in, and exhibit some level of comprehension of, visual social signals. At the same time, the shaping and sharpening of visual expertise is something that takes place gradually through development into adult life. Understanding the construction of social circuits in the adult brain thus necessarily comes at the meeting point of nature and nurture, since most complex primate social interactions draw upon predetermined brain areas but are learned through experience.Our research into social circuitry of the cerebral cortex draws upon electrophysiological and functional imaging methods in two different primate species, the macaque and the marmoset.  In these two species, we have are developing different methods to ask questions about how primate brains are specialized for social information.  Gaining deeper insights into operational principles of social circuits and pathways is directly relevant to human psychiatric disease, which is more often than not plagued by deficits in social perception or behavior.  Progress in the past years has provided a framework for thinking about topics such as face perception in terms of the areal layout and connections, as it is now well-established that there is a face-processing network occupying select regions of the temporal and frontal cortex.  In both species under study, we are investigating the nature of activity within different nodes of this network.  In the macaque, we have exploited the long-term longitudinal recordings afforded by microwire bundles implanted into different so-called face patches, which are the nodes in the face network.   In the marmoset, we recently discovered a similar set of patches, and we are developing methods to investigate longitudinal neural responses in these patches as well, in this case using Ca++ signals coupled with optical imaging.

","Social Processing and Neural Plasticity


","Section on Cognitive Neurophysiology and Imaging, NIMH","
The first face and body-selective neurons in the brain were discovered nearly 50 years ago. Nonetheless, it is only recently that studying social signals in the primate brain has become popular, in part because early researchers were skeptical that the brain would explicitly respond to, or represent, individual faces.  This initial skepticism is mostly dissipated, and the recent burgeoning of the field of social neuroscience is of great importance not only for understanding the construction of the brain, but also for understanding the basis of social deficits that accompany many psychiatric illnesses.Our recent research in the macaque has asked how neurons in the high-level visual cortex respond to social stimuli presented in different contexts.  Over the past year, we have extensively used a microwire bundle array developed and modified in our laboratory, in collaboration with Prof. Igor Bondar,  that is able to longitudinally track the activity of cells in the brain that reside in so-called face patches. Face patches are small, circumscribed regions of the temporal and prefrontal cortex showing greater fMRI responses to faces than to other categories of stimuli.  The longitudinal nature of the recordings allows us to investigate individual neurons for weeks or months at a time.  Since our early work established that neurons in these areas are remarkably stable in their responses, testing over this period means that we are able to examine how single cells respond to a very large array of artificial and natural stimuli and conditions.We are currently completing three studies related to the selectivity of neurons within macaque face patches.  In one of these studies, we are investigating the curious role of an internalized average face in the encoding of facial identity.  The associated theory, which is often described as norm-based encoding, posits that the brain responds to individual faces as deviations from an internally stored average prototype. This average prototype is presumably learned through experience during childhood experience with a wide array of different faces.  An intuitive view of how the average face comes into play comes when one thinks of the job of a caricaturist: their job is to accentuate the brain features that distinguish an individuals face from average.  For example, the caricature of a person with particularly bushy eyebrows and a pointed chin will accentuate these features.  In an early study, our laboratory showed evidence that this norm-based encoding was present among face-selective neurons in the macaque brain.  This year we have finished a major follow-up study to that, systematically investigating these responses among local populations in three face-selective areas of the temporal cortex.  We found strong evidence for norm-based tuning for morphed macaque faces, as well as morphed human faces.  Moreover, this selective signal only arose after >200ms, long after the neurons initial response latency.  Based on several observations, including measures of cell-to-cell activity coherence, we posit that this tuning is the product of late inhibition, whereby a subset of specialized neurons transmit broad inhibition to the population when the average norm face is shown. In a related study in macaques, we asked which facial features are the critical elements for driving neurons in the different face patches.  One of the findings in that study, which is currently underway, is that the face patches differ markedly in this regard.  This is notable since they appear to respond very similarly to the norm-based tuning paradigm described above  even when the same neurons are considered.  In the anterior fundus face patch, for example, face selective neurons are most strongly influenced by the outer contour of the face, whereas in the anterior medial face patch face selective neurons are most strongly influenced by internal facial structure.   Moreover, these face patches also differ in regard to the plasticity that emerges with growing familiarity of stimuli over time.  Whereas the anterior fundus face patches show little if any response change across days and weeks, those in the anterior medial face patch show the selective elimination of late-phase activity that arises after several days.  These two aspects of single-neuron activity that differentiate the two face patches are currently being studied intensively in the lab, and we hope to have definitive results and a manuscript submitted within the coming months.Our work in marmosets is less well established, but has grown substantially in the last year, during which time we have made great headway in areas such as surgical procedures, training regimen, behavioral tracking, optical imaging, and viral expression and histology.  With this progress, our marmoset laboratory is now beginning to generate its first results in the domain of optical imaging. The marmoset laboratory has two main branches.  In the first, we are investigating acting within face selective regions of the brain using Ca++ imaging and implanted lenses, technically similar work widely carried out in mice.  We are now at the stage of collecting data from marmosets expressing the associated fluorescent signals in their brain, and we anticipate that within the next year we will have results related to the diversity and longitudinal stability of face selective responses in the marmoset brain.  In the second branch, we are investigating the natural social interplay between marmosets, using a highly precise tracking system to measure the position and gaze direction of multiple individuals.  Within the next year, we plan to measure neural activity within socially related brain areas in this freely moving environment.  The marmoset work is part of a strong collaboration with several extramural laboratories.  In the coming year, we plan to additionally begin research into the neurodevelopment of these social circuits.   This past year, several intramural investigators were awarded a DDIR Innovation Award to study neurodevelopment in marmosets, and much of our current work is building toward that goal.  We will begin by attempting to identify the critical windows and learning principles through which the brain specializes itself through experience dependent plasticity to identify individual faces.

Nonetheless, it is only recently that studying social signals in the primate brain has become popular, in part because early researchers were skeptical that the brain would explicitly respond to, or represent, individual faces.  This initial skepticism is mostly dissipated, and the recent burgeoning of the field of social neuroscience is of great importance not only for understanding the construction of the brain, but also for understanding the basis of social deficits that accompany many psychiatric illnesses.Our recent research in the macaque has asked how neurons in the high-level visual cortex respond to social stimuli presented in different contexts.  Over the past year, we have extensively used a microwire bundle array developed and modified in our laboratory, in collaboration with Prof. Igor Bondar,  that is able to longitudinally track the activity of cells in the brain that reside in so-called face patches. Face patches are small, circumscribed regions of the temporal and prefrontal cortex showing greater fMRI responses to faces than to other categories of stimuli.  The longitudinal nature of the recordings allows us to investigate individual neurons for weeks or months at a time.  Since our early work established that neurons in these areas are remarkably stable in their responses, testing over this period means that we are able to examine how single cells respond to a very large array of artificial and natural stimuli and conditions.We are currently completing three studies related to the selectivity of neurons within macaque face patches.  In one of these studies, we are investigating the curious role of an internalized average face in the encoding of facial identity.  The associated theory, which is often described as norm-based encoding, posits that the brain responds to individual faces as deviations from an internally stored average prototype. This average prototype is presumably learned through experience during childhood experience with a wide array of different faces.  An intuitive view of how the average face comes into play comes when one thinks of the job of a caricaturist: their job is to accentuate the brain features that distinguish an individuals face from average.  For example, the caricature of a person with particularly bushy eyebrows and a pointed chin will accentuate these features.  In an early study, our laboratory showed evidence that this norm-based encoding was present among face-selective neurons in the macaque brain.  This year we have finished a major follow-up study to that, systematically investigating these responses among local populations in three face-selective areas of the temporal cortex.  We found strong evidence for norm-based tuning for morphed macaque faces, as well as morphed human faces.  Moreover, this selective signal only arose after >200ms, long after the neurons initial response latency.  Based on several observations, including measures of cell-to-cell activity coherence, we posit that this tuning is the product of late inhibition, whereby a subset of specialized neurons transmit broad inhibition to the population when the average norm face is shown. In a related study in macaques, we asked which facial features are the critical elements for driving neurons in the different face patches.  One of the findings in that study, which is currently underway, is that the face patches differ markedly in this regard.  This is notable since they appear to respond very similarly to the norm-based tuning paradigm described above  even when the same neurons are considered.  In the anterior fundus face patch, for example, face selective neurons are most strongly influenced by the outer contour of the face, whereas in the anterior medial face patch face selective neurons are most strongly influenced by internal facial structure.   Moreover, these face patches also differ in regard to the plasticity that emerges with growing familiarity of stimuli over time.  Whereas the anterior fundus face patches show little if any response change across days and weeks, those in the anterior medial face patch show the selective elimination of late-phase activity that arises after several days.  These two aspects of single-neuron activity that differentiate the two face patches are currently being studied intensively in the lab, and we hope to have definitive results and a manuscript submitted within the coming months.Our work in marmosets is less well established, but has grown substantially in the last year, during which time we have made great headway in areas such as surgical procedures, training regimen, behavioral tracking, optical imaging, and viral expression and histology.  With this progress, our marmoset laboratory is now beginning to generate its first results in the domain of optical imaging. The marmoset laboratory has two main branches.  In the first, we are investigating acting within face selective regions of the brain using Ca++ imaging and implanted lenses, technically similar work widely carried out in mice.  We are now at the stage of collecting data from marmosets expressing the associated fluorescent signals in their brain, and we anticipate that within the next year we will have results related to the diversity and longitudinal stability of face selective responses in the marmoset brain.  In the second branch, we are investigating the natural social interplay between marmosets, using a highly precise tracking system to measure the position and gaze direction of multiple individuals.  Within the next year, we plan to measure neural activity within socially related brain areas in this freely moving environment.  The marmoset work is part of a strong collaboration with several extramural laboratories.  In the coming year, we plan to additionally begin research into the neurodevelopment of these social circuits.   This past year, several intramural investigators were awarded a DDIR Innovation Award to study neurodevelopment in marmosets, and much of our current work is building toward that goal.  We will begin by attempting to identify the critical windows and learning principles through which the brain specializes itself through experience dependent plasticity to identify individual faces.

The major goal of our research is to elucidate how our remarkable ability to recognize objects, scenes, faces and bodies (our own and others) is accomplished by the brain. In particular, we are interested in the role of learning and experience. To achieve this goal we measure behaviorally how well people can recognize or learn to recognize different objects, faces, body parts (e.g. hands, feet, legs) or scenes and then use functional brain imaging to measure changes in brain activity as participants perform different visual tasks on these stimuli (NCT00001360). Determining how the brain learns to extract information about ourselves, others and objects from the complex input captured by the eyes provides important insights into our perception of the world we see. Such knowledge is critical for understanding the deficits in perception and social behaviors that accompany many mental health and neurological disorders.

","Object, face,  body and scene representations in the human brain


","Section on Learning and Plasticity, NIMH","
The goal of this research is to understand how we see what we see: how does the brain analyze the light falling on the retina of the eye to reveal a world full of objects, people and things? During the past year we have focused on the perception of complex visual stimuli, in particular real-world visual scenes and objects (NCT00001360).Perception of real world scenes: Real-world scenes are incredibly complex and heterogeneous, yet we are able to identify and categorize them effortlessly. While prior studies have identified three major brain regions that appear to be specialized for scene processing, it remains unclear what the precise roles of these different regions are and what information they contain. Building on a general framework for visual processing we proposed in the past few years, we have been investigating the basic properties of these three scene-selective regions and trying to elucidate how these three regions interact to enable us to understand the world before our eyes. In particular, we have been investigating the extent to which these regions can be explained in terms of encoding low level visual properties (e.g. contrast, color, edges) versus high level properties (e.g. objects, category, actions that can be performed in the depicted scene). One main area of focus has been the relationship between retinotopy (point-by-point mapping of the visual field onto the cortical surface of the brain) and category-selectivity (differential responses to images from different visual categories e.g. scenes versus faces). We evaluate retinotopy by presenting fragments of scenes to specific portions of the visual field and measure the response across the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similarly, we measure category-selectivity by presenting images from different categories (e.g. faces, scenes, objects, bodies) and measuring the associated brain response. We find that there is no simple relationship between these two different organizational principles. Category-selective regions exhibit retinotopy, but individual category-selective regions overlap multiple maps. These results suggests that individual category-selective regions may contain multiple sub-regions within specific retinotopic maps that perform separate computations on the images. We have recently tested multiple models of scene processing and found that the responses in visual cortex can be well predicted by deep neural networks, suggesting that the responses are primarily driven by mid-level visual features and not object-based properties or higher level functional associations of scenes.One of the scene-selective regions is found in medial parietal cortex and is often implicated in memory function and spatial navigation. Our data show that there may be a gradient of function within medial parietal cortex. Posterior regions show strong retinotopy and scene-selectivity and are most strongly connected with other regions of posterior visual cortex. In contrast anterior regions are much less retinotopic and scene-selective but show strong connectivity with regions of ventral temporal cortex and parietal cortex that are implicated in memory. Further, asking subjects to construct scenes by recalling specific episodes from their memory elicits activation overlapping with these anterior regions. Across subjects, there is high consistency in the anatomical location of regions showing perceptual scene selectivity and those showing scene construction responses with the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus separating them.To test the functional role of these scene-selective regions, we focused on a region in occipito-parietal cortex  and applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt neural processing during a task in which subjects freely viewed scene stimuli. We found that gaze behavior was disrupted in a retinotopically-specific manner, suggesting a role for this region in guiding eye movements across scenes.Collectively these results provide important insights into the brain network that is involved in processing real-world visual scenes and we have recently developed a specific framework for thinking about the distributed processing of scenes within visual cortex. We are continuing to evaluate the specific roles of scene-selective regions by i) using TMS to temporarily disrupt their function and observe the impact on behavior; ii) comparing explicit computational and theoretical models of scene representation with the representations observed in different parts of the brain.Perception of Objects:Visual object perception is typically thought to arise from hierarchical processing of the visual input in the brain producing increasingly abstract representations from edges to mid-level features to whole objects to conceptual properties. To understand the nature of object processing, we have processed on two specific issues:1)	Temporal evolution of object representationsTo estimate a lower temporal limit for the emergence of conceptual representations we measured brain responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG), which provides measurements with high temporal resolution, while subjects viewed a large set of object images. By testing models derived from behavioral judgments, semantics and different layers of deep neural networks, we estimate that conceptual object representations start to emerge around 150 ms following stimulus onset. Prior to this time, responses primarily seem to reflect specific visual features of the images and show little generalization across different images of the same type of object.2)	Representational dynamics of both task and object processingDespite the importance of an observers goals in determining how a visual object is categorized, surprisingly little is known about how humans process the task context in which objects occur and how it may interact with the processing of objects. Using MEG, we studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of task and object processing. Our results reveal a sequence of separate but overlapping task-related processes spread across frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex. Task exhibited late effects on object processing by selectively enhancing task-relevant object features, with limited impact on the overall pattern of object representations. Combining MEG with previously collected fMRI data, we reveal a parallel rise in task-related signals throughout the cerebral cortex, with an increasing dominance of task over object representations from early to higher visual areas. Collectively, our results reveal the complex dynamics underlying task and object representations throughout human cortex.Collectively these results provide important insights into the brain network that is involved in processing visual objects. We are currently conducting a large-scale study of both behavioral and neural responses to thousands of object images to better characterize the nature of the representations and the underlying neural processing.Elucidating how the brain enables us to recognize objects, scenes, faces and bodies provides important insights into the nature of our internal representations of the world around us. Understanding these representations is vital in trying to determine the underlying deficits in many mental health and neurological disorders.

The ability of primates, both human and non-human, to effortlessly recognize faces, sometimes many years after a single encounter, has been attributed to the existence of specialized neural machinery for face perception. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the functional architecture of face processing in the primate brain using a variety of neurobiological techniques, including functional brain imaging, single-cell recording, deactivation (both acute and chronic), microstimulation, pharmacological manipulation, and tract tracing with MRI-visible compounds. Whenever possible, results from humans are compared to those from monkeys, so that cross-species comparisons are possible. Because recognizing faces and facial expressions is crucial for appropriate social interactions, a better understanding of the neural mechanisms for face processing should have a major impact on the treatment of disorders of social cognition, such as autism, schizophrenia, and anxiety. This work was conducted under protocol 93-M-0170 (NCT00001360) and 12-M-0128 (NCT01617408).

","Functional Anatomy of Face Processing in the Primate Brain


","Section on Neurocircuitry, NIMH","
Lesions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex in humans can result in the syndrome termed prosopagnosia, an inability to recognize familiar faces. Single-cell recordings from IT cortex of monkeys have revealed the existence of neurons that are selectively activated by visual images of faces. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of both human and monkey brains has demonstrated face-selective regions, in which the fMRI signal evoked by faces is greater compared to that evoked by non-face objects. Together, these studies point to specialized neural machinery in the primate brain for processing faces. Thus far, our group and others have shown that the neural circuitry for face processing consists of a network of brain regions in the temporal and prefrontal cortex as well as in the amygdala.During the past year, we have made a number of important discoveries regarding the neural mechanisms mediating face processing:1. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala led to stronger fMRI activation in face- than object-selective regions in the monkey temporal lobe, indicating that cortical face processing is strongly modulated by feedback from the amygdala, which likely conveys the emotion signaled by anothers expression and focuses the viewers attention on diagnostic facial features.2. The pattern of eye movements in monkeys revealed that, like humans, they experience face pareidolia, the experience of perceiving faces on inanimate objects, indicating that this illusion is driven by a broadly-tuned face detection mechanism that we share with other species. 3. Monkeys with bilateral amygdala lesions, unlike normal monkeys, showed no preference for viewing faces or illusory faces, indicating that the amygdala is critical for our earliest specialized response to faces, a behavior thought to be a precursor for efficient social communication. 4. Thetaburst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS), which temporarily disrupts neural activity, delivered over the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) reduced the neural response to dynamic faces (but not to bodies or objects) in the posterior STS, anterior STS and amygdala, compared to TBS delivered over the vertex, indicating a cortico-amygdala pathway via the STS for dynamic face perception in humans.5. Intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide and potential treatment for autism, selectively altered fMRI responses to emotional expressions in monkeys, significantly reducing responses to both fearful and aggressive faces in face-responsive regions while leaving responses to appeasing and neutral faces unchanged, thereby explaining the beneficial effects of oxytocin on social cognition.6. TBS applied on dorsal locationprocessing regions in humansreduced fMRI activity within ventral stream face-processing regions during configural but not featural face processing, indicating  that ventral stream face-processing regions receive visuospatial information from dorsal stream location-processing regions during configural face processing.7. Patients with Moebius syndrome (MoS), a rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by facial paralysis, showed an impairment in their ability to recognize emotional expressions in others, indicating that the perception of emotional expressions depends on the ability to produce those expressions oneself.8. Resting-state fMRI showed reduced posterior STS-amygdala connectivity relative to fusiform face area-amygdala connectivity in MoS compared to healthy controls, suggesting that the neurocircuitry underlying emotion processing may be altered in MoS.9. Several curvature-selective regions of the posterior cerebral cortex were identified in humans that overlapped face-selective regions, suggesting that face selectivity might arise from curvature selectivity.

The ability of primates, both human and non-human, to effortlessly recognize faces, sometimes many years after a single encounter, has been attributed to the existence of specialized neural machinery for face perception. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the functional architecture of face processing in the primate brain using a variety of neurobiological techniques, including functional brain imaging, single-cell recording, deactivation (both acute and chronic), microstimulation, pharmacological manipulation, and tract tracing with MRI-visible compounds. Whenever possible, results from humans are compared to those from monkeys, so that cross-species comparisons are possible. Because recognizing faces and facial expressions is crucial for appropriate social interactions, a better understanding of the neural mechanisms for face processing should have a major impact on the treatment of disorders of social cognition, such as autism, schizophrenia, and anxiety. This work was conducted under protocol 93-M-0170 (NCT00001360) and 12-M-0128 (NCT01617408).

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disorders primarily affecting social interaction, communication, and flexibility of behavior. Much remains unknown about the neural bases and correlates of these pervasive developmental disorders. The major goal of our studies is to utilize neuroimaging technologies (functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI, structural MRI, magnetoencephalography MEG), and neuropsychological instruments (clinical neuropsychological tests, questionnaires, eye-tracking, and specific measures of memory and cognition) to identify the neural correlates of the social and communicative deficits characteristic of ASD individuals.  This work was conducted under protocol NCT01031407.

","The Cognitive Neuroscience of Autism Spectrum Disorders


","Section on Cognitive Neuropsychology, NIMH","
This past year we have continued to evaluate the neural characteristics and associated behavioral consequences of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Prevailing theories suggest that ASD results from impaired brain communication due to aberrant timing or coordination of neuronal firing patterns (impaired synchrony). However, it remains debated whether synchrony abnormalities in ASD are among local and/or long-range circuits, are circuit-specific or are generalized, reflect increased (hyper-) synchrony and/or decreased (hypo-) synchrony, and whether they are frequency band specific or are distributed across the frequency spectrum. In previous studies, we used data driven techniques in conjunction with both fMRI and structural data to show that the abnormalities in ASD brain networks are most prominent within brain regions that support social functions. To provide an additional test of this hypothesis we used MEG to record spontaneously oscillating neural signals from high functioning adolescents and adults with ASD and typically developing control subjects. We used a method recently developed in our lab to look at all-to-all synchronization across the brain in conjunction with data driven analyses to compare local and long-distance synchrony in a frequency-specific manner. We found that individuals with ASD showed local increased or hypersynchrony in the theta band (4-7 Hz) in lateral occipitotemporal cortex. We also observed long-range decreased or hyposynchronous activity in the alpha band (10-13 Hz) that was most prominent in neural circuitry underpinning social processing. The magnitude of this alpha band hyposynchrony was correlated with social symptom severity. These results suggest that while ASD is associated with both decreased long-range synchrony and increased posterior local synchrony - with each effect limited to a specific frequency band - impairments in social functioning may be most related to decreased alpha synchronization between critical nodes of the social processing network (Ghuman et al., 2017).In the past year we have now begun to turn our attention to determining whether it is possible to modify these aberrant networks, and if so, whether this modification will be clinically relevant. To address these questions we developed a novel covert neurofeedback procedure that may potentially expand the treatment and training options for individuals suffering from a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. Our study utilized an fMRI-based training technique in which positive feedback is provided based on correlations of brain activity between different regions of a brain network known to exhibit abnormal connectivity (weak signal correlation) in ASD patients (based on an independent analysis of over 60 high- functioning ASD and 60 control subjects studied in our lab). As opposed to traditional training techniques, this approach grants direct access to the aberrant networks themselves. Using this form of covert neurofeedback, we observed significantly stronger correlations in the networks being trained after four, two-hour neurofeedback sessions. Moreover, the resulting change was long-term, and was mostly maintained for as long as a year later, including transfer to the resting state. In addition, and perhaps most importantly, this brain network change was correlated with a change in behavior, as measured by parent questionnaires (Ramot et al., eLife, 2017). These results have important implications for any neuropsychiatric disorder in which there are underlying network connectivity issues, as well as for many basic science questions. Indeed, we are currently using a similar approach to determine if we can modify the neural circuits associated with developmental prosopagnosia (abnormally poor memory for faces), and whether any observed changed in network structure will impact real-world face recognition ability. During the past year we have also continued our investigations of the neural underpinnings of social communicative difficulties (Crutcher et al., Human Brain Mapping, 2018) and sensory deficits in ASD (specifcally in gustatory processing, Avery et al., Neuroimage Clinical, 2018). Picky eating and other poor eating habits are common among adolescents with ASD and are often related to aberrant sensory experience, including heightened reactivity to food taste and texture. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms that underlie eating difficulties in ASD. To address this issue, we evaluated neural responses to gustatory stimuli using fMRI and its relation to self-reported eating habits.  We found that eating-related problems were associated with abnormally strong brain responses in gustatory cortex to pictures of foods, as well as with atypical functional connectivity of gustatory cortex with other regions of the brain.  These brain-based differences may predispose these individuals to maladaptive and unhealthy patterns of selective eating behavior.Continued effort has also been directed towards evaluating differences and commonalities in the clinical profiles of adolescent ASD girls and boys (Ratto et al., Journal of Autism & Developmental Disorders, 2018; White et al., Autism Research, 2017).  Of particular interest, our large-scale study of age- and IQ-matched ASD adolescents (n = 228) revealed that, although females and males were rated similarly on gold-standard diagnostic measures overall (ADOS and ADI-R), females with higher IQs were less likely to meet criteria on the ADI-R. Females were also found to be signicantly more impaired on parent reported autistic traits and adaptive skills. Overall, these findings suggest that some autistic females may be missed by current diagnostic procedures, thereby providing evidence for the need for clinical instruments specificaly designed for the evaluating ASD in females.

The Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS) is a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers that works extensively in collaboration with the Clinical Center (CC) and other Institutes. The staff in the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) at NIMH are focused on research, aligned with and contributing to the mission of NIMH to reduce the burden of mental illness, that is focused on the interface between mental and physical health. The three main areas we study are: 1) suicide risk in the medical setting, 2) mental health aspects of coping with chronic medical illness across the lifespan, and 3) neuropsychiatric aspects of immune and infectious disorders (including HIV/AIDS), rare genetic and other medical disorders. Since the OCD is primarily focused on the administration of clinical research and training for the overall NIMH intramural research program, most of our individual research time is conducted through collaborations with both NIH intramural and extramural researchers and clinicians to leverage our resources for the most impact possible. In addition, all the NIMH Consult Services (PCLS, Neuropsychology Assessment, and Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping, and the Sleep and Neurodevelopment Services) work with other Clinical Center medical investigators to study the psychiatric co-morbidities associated with various disease states and participate in behavioral and cognitive phenotyping of rare diseases. In 2017, the Office of the Clinical Director was able to establish a new protocol to recruit and characterize healthy research volunteers to support NIMH intramural researchers.

","Office of the Clinical Director, NIMH","
The main areas of OCD research are:Suicide Risk in the Medical SettingSuicide is an international public health threat. In the U.S., it is the 2nd leading cause of death for youth and the 10th leading cause of death for adults. The Director of NIMH, Dr. Joshua Gordon has made suicide prevention research an NIMH priority and has a mission to reduce the national suicide rate by 20% by the year 2025. As suicide risk screening becomes a national priority for medical settings, non-mental health clinicians require valid, psychometrically-sound screening instruments for assessing suicide risk. However, there are very few suicide risk screening instruments that have been validated empirically with medically ill patients in hospital settings. Recognizing this gap early and capitalizing on clinical and research expertise within our group, we began developing a risk of suicide screen for pediatric patients in the emergency room in 2008 that resulted in a validated tool, the ASQ (Ask Suicide Screening Questions). Due to public demand, the ASQ has now been translated into 12 languages including Spanish, French, Dutch, Arabic, Portuguese, Hebrew, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Vietnamese, Somali and Chinese and is currently being implemented in emergency departments, inpatient medical units and outpatient primary care clinics in the U.S. and abroad. The tool has now been expanded to include the materials necessary for hospitals to begin to implement their own suicide risk screening programs, including scripts for nurses, flyers for parents, and other helpful resources. The ASQ toolkit can be found at the NIMH website http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ASQ for public use. The ASQ Toolkit has been viewed by the public over 54,000 times and has guided medical practitioners in hospital settings across the country. Since the development of the ASQ, the focus of our ongoing suicide risk screening studies has been to develop and validate brief screening instruments that can be administered by non-mental health clinicians in other medical settings and with specific patient populations. We currently have 5 IRB-approved protocols addressing suicide screening in different medical settings (NCT00623493, NCT01517126, NCT02140177, NCT02050867, NCT02830334). We are addressing areas of need, including pediatric and adult emergency department patients, pediatric and adult medical inpatients, and are developing a screening tools for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disabilities. Our research team worked closely with NIH Clinical Center leadership to meet the Joint Commission recommendations and were on the team of leaders that rolled out suicide risk screening in both adult and pediatric inpatients at the NIH Clinical Center. Turning research into practice, we are utilizing our research to inform implementation of suicide risk screening at the NIH CC and hospitals and pediatric outpatient primary care and specialty clinics nationwide. Mental Health Aspects of Coping with Chronic Medical IllnessBorn out of our clinical work on the PCLS and Neuropsychology Assessment Service for the past decade, a natural research focus has emerged from our collaborative work with other Institutes at NIH. For example, working with the Pediatric Oncology Branch we began to study distress and its correlates in medically ill children, particularly those with life-limiting illnesses, through 3 protocols over the past 6 years (NCT00824278, NCT00969579, NCT02423031). The collaboration has been highly productive leading to the development of the first advance care planning guide for adolescents and young adults with life-limiting illnesses, Voicing My CHOiCES. This planning guide is available at www.agingwithdignity.org. In addition, our work in quantifying distress using a thermometer was implemented in a pilot assessment of adult patients undergoing radiation treatment at the Clinical Center in 2018. Development and validation of Checking In, a brief electronic interactive screening measure of distress designed to identify emotional, physical, social, practical and spiritual concerns of pediatric patients, is now in a feasibility testing phase, with a plan to test the instrument in several different community settings. An accompanying provider summary sheet that delineates patient report of distress will allow providers to triage services to patients and their families, thereby enhancing patient quality of life throughout their treatment trajectory.Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Immune and Infectious Disorders (including HIV/AIDS), Genetic, and other DisordersThe OCD Neuropsychology Assessment Service is involved in a broad range of research protocols that are studying cognitive and emotional functioning in various medical groups. These research protocols include genetic disorders (such as Mobius syndrome, methylmalonic academia, McCune-Albright syndrome, Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)), infectious and immune diseases (HIV, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Ebola, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis), brain tumor (re-irradiation effects), and chronic fatigue syndrome.  In addition, the OCD Neuropsychology Assessment Service also plays a vital role in assisting NINDS researchers who are studying Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and other disorders.A large focus of these neuropsychiatric studies is HIV/AIDS. HIV-related research activities in the OCD fall into two categories: 1) NIH Intramural NeuroHIV Program, and 2) Collaborations with multi-site research networks, including an NIH DoD HIV/AIDS associated neurocognitive disorder protocol. The NIMH OCD, NINDS and NIAID have developed 2 intramural protocols (NCT01875588; NCT01692236) investigating HIV-related neurocognitive disorders, which are a clinical challenge and threat to the long-term health of people living with HIV/AIDS.  We have worked to assess the mental health needs of HIV patients and build an interdisciplinary approach to HIV and mental health in DC, leading to funded projects being initiated at other DC institutions. NIMH Clinical Research SupportIn 2017, the Office of the Clinical Director established a new protocol, Recruitment and characterization of healthy research volunteers for NIMH Intramural studies (NCT03304665). The study objectives are to screen and create a list of adult volunteers in good health for participation in research studies conducted in the NIMH Intramural Research Program; to develop a normative set of brain MRI scans that are linked to clinical information collected from healthy research volunteers; and to maximize the scientific impact of data from healthy volunteers by broadly sharing data with other researchers. The study was developed to address several needs; heathy volunteers are used in 80% of NIMH clinical studies. Centralizing recruitment more efficiently utilizes existing resources, provides consistent clinical characterization and screening, and mobilizes the ability to share data through public repositories. Study highlights include the use of an online website for initial consent and self-report survey measures, followed by an in-person appointment for clinical evaluation for study eligibility. Participants must agree to broad data sharing or will not be enrolled. The optional MRI scan (structural and functional) can serve as the annual clinical scan.

The Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS) is a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers that works extensively in collaboration with the Clinical Center (CC) and other Institutes. The staff in the Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) at NIMH are focused on research, aligned with and contributing to the mission of NIMH to reduce the burden of mental illness, that is focused on the interface between mental and physical health. The three main areas we study are: 1) suicide risk in the medical setting, 2) mental health aspects of coping with chronic medical illness across the lifespan, and 3) neuropsychiatric aspects of immune and infectious disorders (including HIV/AIDS), rare genetic and other medical disorders. Since the OCD is primarily focused on the administration of clinical research and training for the overall NIMH intramural research program, most of our individual research time is conducted through collaborations with both NIH intramural and extramural researchers and clinicians to leverage our resources for the most impact possible. In addition, all the NIMH Consult Services (PCLS, Neuropsychology Assessment, and Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping, and the Sleep and Neurodevelopment Services) work with other Clinical Center medical investigators to study the psychiatric co-morbidities associated with various disease states and participate in behavioral and cognitive phenotyping of rare diseases. In 2017, the Office of the Clinical Director was able to establish a new protocol to recruit and characterize healthy research volunteers to support NIMH intramural researchers.

The goals of these studies are to identify the neurobiology of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and suicide and to find novel therapeutic targets for depression and suicide. In addition, the neurobiological effects of treatments and response to these treatments are studied under this project. Moreover, we perform comprehensive phenotyping with the data from all studies conducted in our Branch which includes genetics, neuropsychological testing, structural and functional brain imaging, electrophysiological studies and peripheral blood measures to identify markers of diagnosis and treatment response. Further, we study symptom and syndrome dimensions of depression (RDoC, NIMH Research Domain Criteria). Finally, we conduct proof-of-concept studies under this protocol to identify putative targets for developing novel antidepressants.Studies underway include:1. An Investigation of the Antidepressant Effects of the Glycine Receptor Antagonist AV-101 (4-chlorokynurenine) in Major Depressive Disorder Design: Male and female patients, ages 18 to 65 years, with a diagnosis of MDD, currently in an episode of major depression, will be recruited. This study will consist of the double-blind crossover administration of either AV-101 (glycine antagonist, (1,080 or 1,440 mg/day given orally) or placebo. The study will assess the efficacy of 2 weeks of a glycine antagonist compared with placebo in improving overall depressive symptomatology in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. Outcome measures: Primary: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score. 2. Neurobiology of SuicideThe aim of this study is to evaluate possible biomarkers of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals currently experiencing a suicidal crisis. In taking a dimensional approach to suicide research, we will be able to study phenomenology across Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) units of analysis, from genes through circuits to self-report and experimental interventions.

","Neurobiology and Target Validation of Novel Therapeutic Agents in Mood Disorders


","Section on Neurobiology and Treatment of Mood Disorders, NIMH","
This Report involves work collected under protocols 01-M-0254 (NCT00024635 ); 08-M-0196 (NCT00759395); 08-M-0150 (NCT00697268); 14-M-0085 (NCT02122562); 07-M-0021 (NCT00397111); 14-M-0041 (NCT02049385); and 07-M-0152 (NCT00472576), 09-M-N230; 15-M-0151 (NCT 02484456), 15-M-0188 (NCT02543983).Results this past year:1. PET radioligand binding to translocator protein (TSPO) is increased in unmedicated depressed subjects. Inflammation is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation, is quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and 11C-PBR28, a TSPO tracer. We sought to (1) investigate TSPO binding in MDD subjects currently experiencing a major depressive episode, (2) investigate the effects of antidepressants on TSPO binding, and (3) determine the relationship of peripheral and central inflammatory markers to cerebral TSPO binding. Twenty-eight depressed MDD subjects (unmedicated (n=12) or medicated (n=16)) and 20 healthy controls (HC) underwent PET imaging using 11C-PBR28. TSPO binding was higher in MDD versus HC in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Unmedicated MDD subjects had the highest level of TSPO binding, followed by medicated MDD subjects, who did not differ from HC. TSPO binding correlated with interleukin-5 in cerebrospinal fluid but with no other central inflammatory markers. In conclusion, this study found a trend towards increased TSPO binding in the brains of MDD subjects, and post hoc analysis extended these findings by demonstrating that this abnormality is significant in unmedicated (but not medicated) MDD subjects.2. Clinical Trial of the Potassium Channel Activator Diazoxide for Major Depressive Disorder Halted Due to Intolerability. Some glutamatergic modulators have demonstrated rapid and relatively sustained antidepressant properties in patients with major depressive disorder. Because the potassium channel activator diazoxide increases glutamate uptake via potassium channel activation, we hypothesized that it might exert antidepressant effects by increasing the removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, thereby reducing excessive glutamate transmission. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-site inpatient clinical study was conducted at the National Institute of Mental Health to assess the efficacy and safety of a 3-week course of diazoxide (200-400 mg daily, twice a day) versus a 3-week course of placebo in 6 participants with treatment-refractory major depressive disorder. The study was halted due to adverse effects (e.g., edema). Although the results are negative, they are an important addition to the literature in this rapidly changing field.3. Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales. Due to the heterogeneity of depressive symptoms-which can include depressed mood, anhedonia, negative cognitive biases, and altered activity levels-researchers often use a combination of depression rating scales to assess symptoms. This study sought to identify unidimensional constructs measured across rating scales for depression and to evaluate these constructs across clinical trials of a rapid-acting antidepressant (ketamine). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on baseline ratings from the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Rating Scale. Inpatients with major depressive disorder (n=76) or bipolar depression (n=43) were participating in clinical ketamine trials. The trajectories of the resulting unidimensional scores were evaluated in 41 subjects with bipolar depression who participated in clinical ketamine trials. The best solution, which exhibited excellent fit to the data, comprised eight factors: Depressed Mood, Tension, Negative Cognition, Impaired Sleep, Suicidal Thoughts, Reduced Appetite, Anhedonia, and Amotivation. Various response patterns were observed across the clinical trial data, both in treatment effect (ketamine versus placebo) and in degree of placebo response, suggesting that use of these unidimensional constructs may reveal patterns not observed with traditional scoring of individual instruments. The empirical identification of unidimensional constructs creates more refined scores that may elucidate the connection between specific symptoms and underlying pathophysiology.4. Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters. Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n=126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change. In conclusion, from a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.

The goals of these studies are to identify the neurobiology of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and suicide and to find novel therapeutic targets for depression and suicide. In addition, the neurobiological effects of treatments and response to these treatments are studied under this project. Moreover, we perform comprehensive phenotyping with the data from all studies conducted in our Branch which includes genetics, neuropsychological testing, structural and functional brain imaging, electrophysiological studies and peripheral blood measures to identify markers of diagnosis and treatment response. Further, we study symptom and syndrome dimensions of depression (RDoC, NIMH Research Domain Criteria). Finally, we conduct proof-of-concept studies under this protocol to identify putative targets for developing novel antidepressants.Studies underway include:1. An Investigation of the Antidepressant Effects of the Glycine Receptor Antagonist AV-101 (4-chlorokynurenine) in Major Depressive Disorder Design: Male and female patients, ages 18 to 65 years, with a diagnosis of MDD, currently in an episode of major depression, will be recruited. This study will consist of the double-blind crossover administration of either AV-101 (glycine antagonist, (1,080 or 1,440 mg/day given orally) or placebo. The study will assess the efficacy of 2 weeks of a glycine antagonist compared with placebo in improving overall depressive symptomatology in patients with treatment-resistant MDD. Outcome measures: Primary: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score. 2. Neurobiology of SuicideThe aim of this study is to evaluate possible biomarkers of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals currently experiencing a suicidal crisis. In taking a dimensional approach to suicide research, we will be able to study phenomenology across Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) units of analysis, from genes through circuits to self-report and experimental interventions. 

This Report involves work collected under protocols 01-M-0254 (NCT00024635 ); 08-M-0196 (NCT00759395); 08-M-0150 (NCT00697268); 14-M-0085 (NCT02122562); 07-M-0021 (NCT00397111); 14-M-0041 (NCT02049385); and 07-M-0152 (NCT00472576), 09-M-N230; 15-M-0151 (NCT 02484456), 15-M-0188 (NCT02543983).Results this past year:1. PET radioligand binding to translocator protein (TSPO) is increased in unmedicated depressed subjects. Inflammation is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation, is quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and 11C-PBR28, a TSPO tracer. We sought to (1) investigate TSPO binding in MDD subjects currently experiencing a major depressive episode, (2) investigate the effects of antidepressants on TSPO binding, and (3) determine the relationship of peripheral and central inflammatory markers to cerebral TSPO binding. Twenty-eight depressed MDD subjects (unmedicated (n=12) or medicated (n=16)) and 20 healthy controls (HC) underwent PET imaging using 11C-PBR28. TSPO binding was higher in MDD versus HC in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (sgPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Unmedicated MDD subjects had the highest level of TSPO binding, followed by medicated MDD subjects, who did not differ from HC. TSPO binding correlated with interleukin-5 in cerebrospinal fluid but with no other central inflammatory markers. In conclusion, this study found a trend towards increased TSPO binding in the brains of MDD subjects, and post hoc analysis extended these findings by demonstrating that this abnormality is significant in unmedicated (but not medicated) MDD subjects.2. Clinical Trial of the Potassium Channel Activator Diazoxide for Major Depressive Disorder Halted Due to Intolerability. Some glutamatergic modulators have demonstrated rapid and relatively sustained antidepressant properties in patients with major depressive disorder. Because the potassium channel activator diazoxide increases glutamate uptake via potassium channel activation, we hypothesized that it might exert antidepressant effects by increasing the removal of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, thereby reducing excessive glutamate transmission. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-site inpatient clinical study was conducted at the National Institute of Mental Health to assess the efficacy and safety of a 3-week course of diazoxide (200-400 mg daily, twice a day) versus a 3-week course of placebo in 6 participants with treatment-refractory major depressive disorder. The study was halted due to adverse effects (e.g., edema). Although the results are negative, they are an important addition to the literature in this rapidly changing field.3. Parsing the heterogeneity of depression: An exploratory factor analysis across commonly used depression rating scales. Due to the heterogeneity of depressive symptoms-which can include depressed mood, anhedonia, negative cognitive biases, and altered activity levels-researchers often use a combination of depression rating scales to assess symptoms. This study sought to identify unidimensional constructs measured across rating scales for depression and to evaluate these constructs across clinical trials of a rapid-acting antidepressant (ketamine). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on baseline ratings from the Beck Depression Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Rating Scale. Inpatients with major depressive disorder (n=76) or bipolar depression (n=43) were participating in clinical ketamine trials. The trajectories of the resulting unidimensional scores were evaluated in 41 subjects with bipolar depression who participated in clinical ketamine trials. The best solution, which exhibited excellent fit to the data, comprised eight factors: Depressed Mood, Tension, Negative Cognition, Impaired Sleep, Suicidal Thoughts, Reduced Appetite, Anhedonia, and Amotivation. Various response patterns were observed across the clinical trial data, both in treatment effect (ketamine versus placebo) and in degree of placebo response, suggesting that use of these unidimensional constructs may reveal patterns not observed with traditional scoring of individual instruments. The empirical identification of unidimensional constructs creates more refined scores that may elucidate the connection between specific symptoms and underlying pathophysiology.4. Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters. Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n=126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change. In conclusion, from a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.

The goal of this research program is to understand how the brain learns from experience.  In day-to-day life, we make choices when confronted with options, and those choices lead to outcomes.  Learning from experience is the process of learning how to make choices that lead to positive outcomes and to avoid choices that lead to negative outcomes.  The same brain systems also underlie learning from experience, when the experiences happen in the absence of choices.  For example, various types of trauma can lead to feelings of anxiety surrounding the context in which the trauma occurred.  Pathology in these systems can lead to several mental health disorders including anxiety, depression and behavioral addictions.  Anxiety, along with these other disorders, represents a major public health burden with the lifetime prevalence of any anxiety disorder over 15% globally, leading to costs to society of approximately $42 billion in the 1990s (CDC).A set of interconnected brain areas (where a set of interconnected areas is often referred to as a neural system) work collectively during learning.  The neural systems that underlie learning include the amygdala, ventral-striatum, prefrontal cortical areas and the dopamine system.  A major goal of our lab is to understand how each of these areas contribute to learning, and how they work together as a system.  Current models of learning assume that dopamine codes a reward prediction error.  The reward prediction error is the difference between a predicted reward, and the reward one actually receives.  They can arise from rewards that are larger (a positive reward prediction error) or smaller (a negative reward prediction error) than predicted.  They can also arise from punishments that are smaller (a positive reward prediction error) or larger (a negative reward prediction error) than predicted.  When outcomes are perfectly predicted, because one has learned to predict the outcome perfectly, there is no reward prediction error and there is no dopamine signal.  The reward prediction error coded by dopamine neurons is broadcast to much of the brain.  However, current models assume that it is most specifically the ventral-striatum that receives the reward prediction error signal, and uses that signal to update outcome estimates.  Dopamine can be thought of as the teacher, and the ventral-striatum as the student.  In this case, however, dopamine can only tell the ventral-striatum whether the outcome was better or worse than expected.  Our recent work has built on this basic idea by showing that the role of the ventral-striatum is more specific than previously thought, and that the amygdala also plays a more important role than previously thought.  More specifically, the ventral-striatum is important for learning that accumulates slowly over time, whereas the amygdala is important for learning quickly from recent outcomes.  Portions of this work are conducted under protocol 13-M-0190, NCT01950377.

Our lab uses a combination of neurophysiology, pharmacology and imaging to understand how a set of brain areas composed of the amygdala, ventral-striatum, prefrontal cortical areas and dopamine underlie learning.

 Despite the importance of puberty in the emergence of several disease states, there is surprisingly little known about either the endocrine events accompanying puberty in humans or the impact of these events on normal developmental neurobiology. Epidemiologic studies have identified sexual dimorphisms in the prevalence of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and substance abuse. Many of these sex differences emerge during or shortly after puberty and are maintained until the 5th-6th decade of life. Basic neuroscience research has demonstrated that hormonal events accompanying puberty impact many of the physiologic systems involved in the regulation of brain function (e.g., the appearance of new neurons in a brain-region specific pattern, neuronal remodeling, and the pruning of cortical connectivity). Additionally, neuroimaging studies in humans have documented the manifold changes in brain structure and function during adolescence. While important and unequivocal findings about human neurodevelopment have emerged from these studies, many questions remain to be answered about the role of puberty-related endocrine and metabolic events on brain development during adolescence. In humans, puberty involves the (re)activations of several separate but overlapping hormonal systems that include adrenal androgen production (adrenarche), the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (gonadarche), and the growth axes (growth spurt) each of which individually could influence brain development. However, there is considerable individual variation in the timing, rate of development, and the relative synchrony of each of these processes. Thus, cross-sectional efforts to link specific endocrine or metabolic events to developmental events in the brain are difficult due to the complexity of the interaction in the physiologic systems changing during puberty, the lack of synchrony in endocrine and growth events across individuals, the non-specificity of the existing classifications of pubertal stage (i.e., Tanner stages) used to predict specific endocrine events, and the use of traditional hormone assays that do not reliably measure steroid levels at the low levels of secretion present during early puberty. Additionally, characterizations of the prepubertal status of boys and girls frequently fail to define baseline conditions sufficiently well to permit the interpretation of changes later in life that are inferred to be secondary to puberty.We perform a longitudinal study of changes in stress responsivity, brain structure and function in relation to a comprehensive characterization of reproductive and growth function in normally-developing boys and girls who are monitored every 8-10 months across the pubertal transition from children who are eight years of age and who meet strict clinical and laboratory evidence of being prepubertal, until age eighteen years (post-puberty). Reproductive endocrine (i.e., gonadal and adrenal steroids measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, bone age, MRI measures of gonadal volume), and metabolic (i.e., growth, measures of visceral fat and body composition) will be employed to fully characterize the stage, duration of pubertal development, and exposure to sex steroids. Additionally, these children meet strict criteria for the presence of normal weight and height since these measures can alter sex steroid exposures. Outcome measures are derived via multimodal neuroimaging techniques, cognitive/behavioral assessments, and cell lines of lymphoblastoid and induced pluripotent cells (to examine in vitro evidence of the effects of sex steroids on gene network function, neuronal and glial function). Finally, we will test selected hypotheses emerging from the literature about the impact of genetic variation on the developmental trajectory of these parameters (both reproductive and CNS).

","Endocrine and Neurobiologic Events Accompanying Puberty


","Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, NIMH","
This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocol: NCT01434368.We have recruited approximately half of the proposed sample, and several of the children in the original 12-13-year-old cohort have completed the study through to their 18th birthday. To date we have studied 57 prepubertal children (33 boys and 24 girls), who are rigorously characterized as pre-gonadarchal by Tanner staging and bone age. These children also have plasma levels of estradiol and testosterone at the lower limits of detectability and have a bimodal distribution of plasma adrenal androgen levels (e.g., DHEA-S, androstenedione) indicating both boys and girls are in either early or later stages of adrenarche. Preliminary neuroimaging findings point to sex-differences particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), suggesting the presence of some sex-differences in functional connectivity prior to HPG axis (re)activation. A connectome-wide association study (CWAS) in this prepubertal cohort identified sex-differences in resting state functional connectivity in the mPFC, a key region in the default-mode network (DMN), a brain network implicated in autobiographical/self-referential memory. Using this mPFC region as a seed, post hoc analysis showed several clusters in the DMN and executive control network in which girls showed higher mPFC connectivity compared to boys, whereas no voxels showed higher connectivity in boys. These preliminary results suggest that there may be neural circuits that exhibit sex-differences prior to gonadarche and HPG axis activation. However, further analysis is needed to determine the factors contributing to sex-differences in this cohort. For example, in addition to possible independent sex-chromosomal effects, sex-differences could reflect greater exposures to adrenal androgens in those children who are in the later stages of adrenarche (which we can examine given the dichotomous distribution of adrenal androgen levels in this sample), or earlier sex steroid exposure secondary to the initial post-natal activation of the HPG axis which lasts 1-2 weeks in boys but up to two years in girls. Initial findings in our combined pre- and post-pubertal cohorts have identified several landmarks in reproductive aging that could have important implications for brain development. We have observed that post-menarcheal girls experience the commencement of fluctuations in estradiol secretion (presumably corresponding to the maturation of the normal architecture of the menstrual cycle). Given our findings of the importance of changes in ovarian steroid levels in RERMDs, these observations could signal an important physiologic event during which functional neurocircuitry undergoes reprogramming. We also have observed in both boys and girls that MRI-measured gonadal volumes increase across the pubertal transition. The individual inflection points in these volume curves identify another important reproductive event (i.e., the expansion of the gonad) that is a sentinel event indicating the initial activation of the GnRH pulse generator, gonadotropin secretion, and the beginning of gonadarche. As enrollment continues and our pre-pubertal children mature, the longitudinal analysis of the development of these sex-differences in brain activity (as well as developmental trajectories in brain that are not sexually dimorphic) could identify specific puberty-related reproductive or metabolic events relevant to normal brain development. These data also will serve as an important archival data set for studies of children at high risk for the development of behavioral disorders. In our larger cohort that includes both the pre-pubertal children as well as children who were enrolled mid-puberty (i.e., ages 12-13 years), preliminary results of multi-modal neuroimaging studies suggest that pubertal stage contributes to several measures of adolescent functional brain development and accounts for differences between adolescent and adult brain development that are both brain region- and sex-specific. First, our evaluation of reward circuitry function shows a main effect of pubertal status in functional connectivity during reward anticipation between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and several brain regions, including prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule, with increased modulation between NAcc and all regions in pre-pubertal children compared to older mid-late pubertal adolescents. However, we have not observed either sex-differences or interactions between pubertal status and sex in the reward system development. Second, our evaluation of the executive control network using a n-back working memory task, we observed no sex or age differences in working memory (WM) performance or reaction time. However, boys activated, but girls deactivated the right hippocampus regardless of pubertal status. Furthermore, prepubertal children showed greater activation than older mid-late pubertal adolescents in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regardless of sex. No sex-by-pubertal-stage interaction was observed in WM-related regions. In pre-pubertal children analyzed alone, boys showed greater activation than girls in the right inferior parietal lobule, medial prefrontal cortex and DLPFC.  The hippocampal sex difference observed regardless of pubertal status was also confirmed in the prepubertal children analyzed alone. In our evaluation of stress responsivity in these children (both prepubertal and mid-late pubertal samples) we have observed a sex difference in the morning wakening cortisol response with girls having a greater salivary cortisol response compared to boys that persists into later puberty. Therefore, our findings suggest (albeit preliminarily) that sex differences in HPA axis appear prior to gonadarche. These findings are analogous to previous adult data from our group in which sex differences in HPA axis responsivity were observed after men and women were made hypogonadal by leuprolide treatment, in response to either exercise or corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation compared with women. Finally, given the multidisciplinary nature of this study, we have observed one incidental finding related to pelvic fluid levels in the abdomen of normally developing children that has not previously been reported. Prior to this report pelvic fluid (PFF) in the abdomen was considered an accompaniment of malignancy or inflammation. In these otherwise healthy children, however, MRI of the pelvis (obtained to measure gonadal volume) showed the normal presence of pelvic fluid that was significantly higher in girls. Thus, among healthy pubescent children, the prevalence of PFF is significantly higher in females. The volume of PFF may reach volumes greater than 10 mL during normal puberty, especially in 4th stage, and can be assumed normal in the absence of active disease.  These findings will inform the clinical assessments of pelvic fluid abnormalities in normal girls.

While important and unequivocal findings about human neurodevelopment have emerged from these studies, many questions remain to be answered about the role of puberty-related endocrine and metabolic events on brain development during adolescence. In humans, puberty involves the (re)activations of several separate but overlapping hormonal systems that include adrenal androgen production (adrenarche), the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis (gonadarche), and the growth axes (growth spurt) each of which individually could influence brain development. However, there is considerable individual variation in the timing, rate of development, and the relative synchrony of each of these processes. Thus, cross-sectional efforts to link specific endocrine or metabolic events to developmental events in the brain are difficult due to the complexity of the interaction in the physiologic systems changing during puberty, the lack of synchrony in endocrine and growth events across individuals, the non-specificity of the existing classifications of pubertal stage (i.e., Tanner stages) used to predict specific endocrine events, and the use of traditional hormone assays that do not reliably measure steroid levels at the low levels of secretion present during early puberty. Additionally, characterizations of the prepubertal status of boys and girls frequently fail to define baseline conditions sufficiently well to permit the interpretation of changes later in life that are inferred to be secondary to puberty.We perform a longitudinal study of changes in stress responsivity, brain structure and function in relation to a comprehensive characterization of reproductive and growth function in normally-developing boys and girls who are monitored every 8-10 months across the pubertal transition from children who are eight years of age and who meet strict clinical and laboratory evidence of being prepubertal, until age eighteen years (post-puberty). Reproductive endocrine (i.e., gonadal and adrenal steroids measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, bone age, MRI measures of gonadal volume), and metabolic (i.e., growth, measures of visceral fat and body composition) will be employed to fully characterize the stage, duration of pubertal development, and exposure to sex steroids. Additionally, these children meet strict criteria for the presence of normal weight and height since these measures can alter sex steroid exposures. Outcome measures are derived via multimodal neuroimaging techniques, cognitive/behavioral assessments, and cell lines of lymphoblastoid and induced pluripotent cells (to examine in vitro evidence of the effects of sex steroids on gene network function, neuronal and glial function). Finally, we will test selected hypotheses emerging from the literature about the impact of genetic variation on the developmental trajectory of these parameters (both reproductive and CNS). 

This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocol: NCT01434368.We have recruited approximately half of the proposed sample, and several of the children in the original 12-13-year-old cohort have completed the study through to their 18th birthday. To date we have studied 57 prepubertal children (33 boys and 24 girls), who are rigorously characterized as pre-gonadarchal by Tanner staging and bone age. These children also have plasma levels of estradiol and testosterone at the lower limits of detectability and have a bimodal distribution of plasma adrenal androgen levels (e.g., DHEA-S, androstenedione) indicating both boys and girls are in either early or later stages of adrenarche. Preliminary neuroimaging findings point to sex-differences particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), suggesting the presence of some sex-differences in functional connectivity prior to HPG axis (re)activation. A connectome-wide association study (CWAS) in this prepubertal cohort identified sex-differences in resting state functional connectivity in the mPFC, a key region in the default-mode network (DMN), a brain network implicated in autobiographical/self-referential memory. Using this mPFC region as a seed, post hoc analysis showed several clusters in the DMN and executive control network in which girls showed higher mPFC connectivity compared to boys, whereas no voxels showed higher connectivity in boys. These preliminary results suggest that there may be neural circuits that exhibit sex-differences prior to gonadarche and HPG axis activation. However, further analysis is needed to determine the factors contributing to sex-differences in this cohort. For example, in addition to possible independent sex-chromosomal effects, sex-differences could reflect greater exposures to adrenal androgens in those children who are in the later stages of adrenarche (which we can examine given the dichotomous distribution of adrenal androgen levels in this sample), or earlier sex steroid exposure secondary to the initial post-natal activation of the HPG axis which lasts 1-2 weeks in boys but up to two years in girls. Initial findings in our combined pre- and post-pubertal cohorts have identified several landmarks in reproductive aging that could have important implications for brain development. We have observed that post-menarcheal girls experience the commencement of fluctuations in estradiol secretion (presumably corresponding to the maturation of the normal architecture of the menstrual cycle). Given our findings of the importance of changes in ovarian steroid levels in RERMDs, these observations could signal an important physiologic event during which functional neurocircuitry undergoes reprogramming. We also have observed in both boys and girls that MRI-measured gonadal volumes increase across the pubertal transition. The individual inflection points in these volume curves identify another important reproductive event (i.e., the expansion of the gonad) that is a sentinel event indicating the initial activation of the GnRH pulse generator, gonadotropin secretion, and the beginning of gonadarche. As enrollment continues and our pre-pubertal children mature, the longitudinal analysis of the development of these sex-differences in brain activity (as well as developmental trajectories in brain that are not sexually dimorphic) could identify specific puberty-related reproductive or metabolic events relevant to normal brain development. These data also will serve as an important archival data set for studies of children at high risk for the development of behavioral disorders. In our larger cohort that includes both the pre-pubertal children as well as children who were enrolled mid-puberty (i.e., ages 12-13 years), preliminary results of multi-modal neuroimaging studies suggest that pubertal stage contributes to several measures of adolescent functional brain development and accounts for differences between adolescent and adult brain development that are both brain region- and sex-specific. First, our evaluation of reward circuitry function shows a main effect of pubertal status in functional connectivity during reward anticipation between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and several brain regions, including prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule, with increased modulation between NAcc and all regions in pre-pubertal children compared to older mid-late pubertal adolescents. However, we have not observed either sex-differences or interactions between pubertal status and sex in the reward system development. Second, our evaluation of the executive control network using a n-back working memory task, we observed no sex or age differences in working memory (WM) performance or reaction time. However, boys activated, but girls deactivated the right hippocampus regardless of pubertal status. Furthermore, prepubertal children showed greater activation than older mid-late pubertal adolescents in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) regardless of sex. No sex-by-pubertal-stage interaction was observed in WM-related regions. In pre-pubertal children analyzed alone, boys showed greater activation than girls in the right inferior parietal lobule, medial prefrontal cortex and DLPFC.  The hippocampal sex difference observed regardless of pubertal status was also confirmed in the prepubertal children analyzed alone. In our evaluation of stress responsivity in these children (both prepubertal and mid-late pubertal samples) we have observed a sex difference in the morning wakening cortisol response with girls having a greater salivary cortisol response compared to boys that persists into later puberty. Therefore, our findings suggest (albeit preliminarily) that sex differences in HPA axis appear prior to gonadarche. These findings are analogous to previous adult data from our group in which sex differences in HPA axis responsivity were observed after men and women were made hypogonadal by leuprolide treatment, in response to either exercise or corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation compared with women. Finally, given the multidisciplinary nature of this study, we have observed one incidental finding related to pelvic fluid levels in the abdomen of normally developing children that has not previously been reported. Prior to this report pelvic fluid (PFF) in the abdomen was considered an accompaniment of malignancy or inflammation. In these otherwise healthy children, however, MRI of the pelvis (obtained to measure gonadal volume) showed the normal presence of pelvic fluid that was significantly higher in girls. Thus, among healthy pubescent children, the prevalence of PFF is significantly higher in females. The volume of PFF may reach volumes greater than 10 mL during normal puberty, especially in 4th stage, and can be assumed normal in the absence of active disease.  These findings will inform the clinical assessments of pelvic fluid abnormalities in normal girls.

Interpretation of changes in images of brain functional activity that are produced by disease or by activation of various pathways requires quantification of the rates of physiological and biochemical processes that underlie the imaging method. In imaging modalities that use radioactive tracers, e.g. positron emission tomography (PET), quantification is carried out by means of a kinetic model that describes the rates of the biochemical reactions in the metabolic pathway of the tracer and traced molecules. Selection of the best kinetic model is critical as the use of an inappropriate model can lead to substantial errors in quantification and possible misinterpretation of results. Once a model is selected, numerical procedures that are efficient, robust, and require minimal assumptions about errors in the measurements are required to estimate kinetic model parameters accurately. Additionally, powerful statistical tests are needed so that the data can be examined for significant differences among experimental groups. The objective of this project is to develop better techniques for addressing these interrelated mathematical and statistical issues.This work was conducted under protocols NCT00884702 and NCT00362843.

In the current year we have completed and published our refined data analysis methods for estimation of rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with L-1-C-11leucine and PET. We also completed validation and publication of the impact of a simplified patient scanning protocol.(1) Refinement of kinetic model analysis methods. Quantification with PET tracers utilizes compartmental models that generally assume homogeneity for each tissue region-of-interest (ROI) with respect to relevant physiological variables. The kinetic model of the C-11leucine PET method was originally applied to ROI data with the assumption that each ROI is homogeneous with respect to concentrations of amino acids, blood flow, transport and metabolism of amino acids, and rCPS. Due to the limited spatial resolution of PET, however, most regions contain a kinetically heterogeneous mixture of tissue components; this may bias estimation results. We have been refining our analyses to minimize effects of tissue heterogeneity on estimates of kinetic parameters and rCPS. We reasoned that a substantial reduction in the volume of a tissue region should reduce the impact of heterogeneity. We developed a method to apply the homogeneous tissue model to analysis of PET data at the voxel level, the Basis Function Method (BFM). We found that voxel-level BFM estimates of rCPS averaged over a ROI were substantially less biased than estimates based on direct fitting of the ROI time-activity curve (TAC) with a homogeneous tissue model. Model fits of the TACs showed that effects of tissue heterogeneity had been reduced, but not eliminated. We developed a second approach that explicitly takes heterogeneity within a ROI into account, spectral analysis with an iterative filter (SAIF). When applied to ROI-level data, SAIF-ROI produced low bias, low variance estimates of rCPS. It performed comparably to the voxel-level BFM method when count rates are normal, but at low count rates it performed better. Although SAIF allows for heterogeneity in a ROI, it does require an assumed constraint on the relationship among the kinetic parameters within the heterogeneous tissues. This has the most impact when kinetics of the various tissues within the ROI are most dissimilar. Under the premise that the dissimilarity among the tissues would be less at the voxel level, we extended the SAIF method for analysis of voxel-level data. In normal count rate studies, rCPS estimated with SAIF-voxel was approximately 5-15% higher than with SAIF-ROI analysis; inter-subject variability was comparable. Based on simulation studies we conclude that the difference is predominantly due to underestimation of rCPS with SAIF-ROI, i.e., the performance SAIF-voxel is better. As a final step, we investigated which data analysis method is optimal under various PET scanning conditions. When scanning with the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT), we found that voxel-level BFM and voxel-level SAIF analyses yielded comparable estimates of rCPS at count rates typical of our studies, but when the injected dose of leucine is unusually low, as when an unavoidable delay in injection occurs, low count rates lead to more biased voxel-level BFM estimates of rCPS. When scanner resolution is lower, however, voxel-level SAIF performs better irrespective of injected dose. We conclude that studies on the high resolution PET scanner, with standard injected doses of C-11leucine, can be analyzed with the computationally simpler voxel-level BFM. (2) Simplification of scanning protocols. One of our goals is to be able to study subjects with intellectual disabilities without the need for sedation, so any changes in the procedure that make the study less onerous for participants may help us to achieve that goal. The C-11leucine method was originally validated with a protocol that requires arterial blood sampling and a 90 min scan time.  We have tested the effects of two changes to the protocol on computed rCPS: 1) shortening the scan duration and 2) substitution of venous for arterial sampling.(a) We have completed our investigation of the effects of shortening the scan duration. We reanalyzed thirty-nine scans in three groups of participants with the voxel-level Basis Function Method (BFM) that is based on a homogeneous tissue model. These scans were acquired on the high resolution scanner and participants were administered doses of C-11leucine that resulted good counting statistics. In these groups we found that rCPS values estimated on a 60 min scanning interval were almost identical to those estimated with the full 90 minutes of acquired data. Furthermore, statistical comparisons of the groups yielded the same results on the 60 and 90 min estimation intervals. This demonstrates that the scanning interval can be reduced to 60 min when counting statistics are good and BFM is used in the analysis. (b) We examined the effects of substituting venous for arterial blood sampling. We use population-derived arterial input functions calibrated by each participant's own measured venous data. Analyses of 22 scans of three groups of participants support the feasibility of utilizing venous in place of arterial blood sampling. We compared rCPS values determined with measured arterial blood data with rCPS based on venous-calibrated population input functions; we found no statistically significant differences in rCPS in either whole brain or any of the 16 regions examined in any group.   We conclude that venous-calibrated population-derived input functions can replace arterial blood input functions.Taken together these validation studies demonstrate that the simplified scanning protocol for the C-11leucine PET method, i.e., a scan time of 60 minutes and use of venous-calibrated population input functions, can be used in C-11leucine studies on the high resolution research tomograph without compromising accuracy of rCPS measurements. This simplified scanning protocol will be employed in all future studies.

The importance of sleep is widely appreciated, but the actual function of sleep remains unknown. The drive for sleep is such that short periods of sleep deprivation result in rebound sleep. In animals, prolonged (2-3 weeks) sleep deprivation is fatal. Sleep is required for normal psychological, hormonal, and executive function. Humans deprived of sleep may suffer psychotic episodes, and disorders of sleep are a prominent component of many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. One hypothesized role for sleep is for restoration of brain structural elements. Based on the premise that restoration of brain structural elements requires protein synthesis, we hypothesize that regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) are increased during sleep.It is widely recognized that inhibition of protein synthesis prevents memory consolidation. It has also been shown that improvements on memory tasks are sleep-dependent. The second goal of this study is to test, in human subjects, this hypothesized role for sleep. We will measure rCPS during sleep-dependent memory consolidation. The goal is to determine directly the relationship between protein synthesis and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. This work was conducted under protocol 09-M-0123, NCT00884702.

","Cerebral Protein Synthesis During Sleep and Memory Consolidation


","Section on Neuro-adaptation and Protein Metabolism, NIMH","
During the FY 2018 funding period, we addressed the following:In collaboration with our colleagues from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (T Balkin) and NINDS (D. Picchioni), we applied the L-1-C-11leucine positron emission tomography (PET) method to measure rCPS in human subjects during sleep. To address the restoration hypothesis of sleep, we measure rCPS in the same participant during normal wakefulness, sleep-deprived wakefulness, and sleep. We hypothesize that rCPS is increased during sleep, but that during sleep-deprived wakefulness, rCPS remain at levels comparable to rested wakefulness. Participants undergo the initial scan in the awake, sleep-sated state. Participants are then kept awake over the next 30 h and subsequently undergo a second PET scan in the sleep-deprived but awake state. Participants are then encouraged to sleep in the scanner while they undergo a third scan during slow wave sleep. Participants are healthy male and female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 28 y. We exclude participants with a history of neurological and psychiatric disorders, chronic medical conditions, and sleep disorders. Our preliminary results indicate no differences in rCPS during slow wave sleep.  We are preparing a manuscript reporting results of these studies.If protein synthesis during sleep is required for sleep-dependent memory consolidation, we might expect rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) to increase during sleep in the local brain circuits that support performance on a particular task following training on that task.  To measure circuit-specific brain protein synthesis during a daytime nap opportunity, we used the L-1-11Cleucine PET method with simultaneous polysomnography.  We trained participants on the texture discrimination task (TDT).  This was followed by a nap opportunity during a 11-Cleucine PET scan, and we retested them later in the day after the scan.  The TDT is considered retinotopically specific, so we hypothesized that higher rCPS in primary visual cortex would be observed in the trained hemisphere compared to the untrained hemisphere in subjects who were randomized to a sleep condition.  Our results indicate that the changes in rCPS in primary visual cortex depended on whether participants were in the wakefulness or sleep condition but were independent of the side of the visual field trained.  That is, only in the participants randomized to sleep, rCPS in the right primary visual cortex was higher than in the left regardless of side trained.  Other brain regions examined were not so affected.  In the participants who slept, performance on the TDT improved similarly regardless of the side trained.  Results indicate a regionally selective and sleep-dependent effect that occurs with improved performance on the TDT.  A manuscript reporting results of these studies was published this year.

Using a multimodal approach involving neuropsychological testing, functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and quantitative measures of magnetic relaxation parameters of brain tissue, we pursue research aimed at understanding how genes, particularly those related to risk for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, affect the brain. The rationale for this work is founded on the premise that the discovery and biological validation of susceptibility genes for psychiatric disorders will lead to the identification of pathophysiological mechanisms and new therapies. We have four primary objectives in this field. First, we aim to identify the functional, molecular and anatomical abnormalities in psychosis that can be linked to genetic predisposition. This objective is carried forward by employing cognitive and other behavioral and clinical measurements and in vivo neuroimaging to identify brain and behavior phenotypes that are not only present in people with psychosis, but also in their unaffected siblings, who share half of their genetic material (trait liability) but do not have psychosis and are not treated with psychotropic medication (state effects). Second, we aim to identify facets of the molecular biology of schizophrenia risk (e.g., specific genotypes, classes of genes, RNA and protein expression) that are associated with the phenotypes mentioned above, even in healthy individuals, thus, providing support for genetic effects on pertinent brain biology. Third, we aim to determine whether risk genotypes predict variability in important clinical characteristics, such as illness heterogeneity and severity, functional impairment, and treatment response. Finally, we aim to identify environmental variables that interact with genetic risk in psychosis and associated biological mechanisms. Toward these ends, over more than a decade of work, we have established one of the largest databases of healthy volunteers, people with schizophrenia, and their unaffected siblings who have been characterized with a broad array of cognitive, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures. This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001486.

","Multimodal Imaging: Genetic and Environmental Effects in Neuropsychiatry


","Section on Integrative Neuroimaging, NIMH","
In order to better understand how schizophrenia risk genetics operate at the cognitive and neural systems level, our recent work under this project has focused on understanding the biological correlates of both polygenic illness risk and gene-by-environment interactions. Ongoing studies in these areas permit better understanding of heritable, trait-related abnormalities in schizophrenia, of the underlying molecular biology responsible for such abnormalities, and of strategies for resolving some of the illness heterogeneity that makes biological research so challenging.Schizophrenia is highly heritable, but its genetic architecture is exceptionally complex.  Recent gains in delineating a host of diverse genetic markers that each show small statistical illness association effects in very large cohorts present major challenges and opportunities to understanding molecular pathways to system-level dysfunction in schizophrenia.  By generating metrics of cumulative schizophrenia risk burden that combine information from schizophrenia risk polymorphisms across the genome, we have been able to test important hypotheses about illness-linked neuroimaging phenotypes. For instance, following a series of MRI experiments in individuals with schizophrenia in which we have established that hippocampal activity measured during memory encoding may be abnormal in patients and also affected in their relatives, we have shown in collaborative work that cumulative, polygenic risk burden for schizophrenia predicts variability in this measurement in healthy individuals (Chen et al, 2018).  We have also shown effects of polygenic risk for late-onset Alzheimers disease on this same measure of hippocampal engagement (Xiao et al, 2017), highlighting the complex molecular underpinnings of these neuroimaging signals. This and similar experimentation incorporating positron emission tomographic measurements ongoing in the Branch provide important validation of target neurophysiological phenotypes that may arise from etiological genetic variation.  In conjunction with genetic factors underlying risk for schizophrenia, environmental influences have been identified as illness risk factors in epidemiological and twin studies, and delineating gene-environment interactions is likely crucial to better understanding the causes of schizophrenia.  Recent research has highlighted two environmental variables that show association with schizophrenia: urbanicity and early life complications.  For instance, we have demonstrated that whether an individual was raised in an urban environment significantly modifies effects of dopamine-related genes on how the prefrontal cortex responds to working memory demands (Reed et al, 2018).  We have further replicated this finding in two additional datasets and posit that urban upbringing may alter brain function in a way that meaningfully intersects with dopaminergic neurogenetic mechanisms.  Other work suggests that the predictive strength of most strongly associated loci from the recent schizophrenia genome-wide association study is greatly amplified when there is a history of clinically significant obstetrical complications (Ursini et al, 2018). These data suggest that traditional univariate approaches must be buttressed by gene-by-environment experimentation to more fully elaborate genetic risk architecture in schizophrenia.

Using a multimodal approach involving neuropsychological testing, functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET), and quantitative measures of magnetic relaxation parameters of brain tissue, we pursue research aimed at understanding how genes, particularly those related to risk for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, affect the brain.

Research in our laboratory focuses on neurotransmitter transporters, the plasma membrane proteins that limit the actions of neurotransmitters following their release from neurons. These carrier proteins catalyze the inward movement of neurotransmitter molecules and have a profound impact on the extent of receptor activation that occurs during neurotransmission. We have also shown that these transporters can possess a substrate-dependent ion channel-like activity, a property that allows them to regulate neuronal excitability and serve as sensors of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations. Neurotransmitter transporters are also well-established targets for addictive drugs including cocaine and amphetamines, for the class of therapeutic antidepressants known as reuptake inhibitors, and for methylphenidate, which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD). The high incidence of ADHD and the increasing use of medications in children provide a compelling rationale for understanding the mechanism of action of drugs used to treat these disorders.  Our work on the intracellular actions of amphetamines has addressed a number of key features of amphetamine action.  It defined the trace amine receptor, TAAR1, as an intracellular receptor for AMPHs within dopamine neurons and has established that it signals through two distinct G-protein pathways. These presynaptic signaling events illustrate that amphetamines can have direct effects on signaling pathways that regulate cellular physiology, homeostasis and, in all likelihood, gene expression within dopamine neurons. Although amphetamine is viewed as a generally safe drug for the treatment of ADHD, these recent findings argue strongly for learning more about the direct effects of this class of drugs on dopamine (DA) signaling.

","Structure, Function and Pharmacology of Neurotransmitter Reuptake Systems


","Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology, NIMH","
Our laboratory has shown that amphetamines trigger the internalization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by a series of intracellular events that are distinct from the generally established actions of amphetamines to inhibit DA uptake or to increase DA efflux. We have found that when applied to cell lines, cultured DA neurons or midbrain slices, amphetamine activates the small GTPases, RhoA and Rac-1 and triggers internalization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by a specialized internalization pathway that requires the activation of the small GTPase, RhoA. Intriguingly, amphetamine must be transported into the cell to have these effects and its actions are actually blocked by cocaine, a drug that inhibits DAT and prevents amphetamine entry. We have also found that elevation of cAMP, via DA receptors or by amphetamine-induced adenylate cyclase activation, inactivates RhoA and limits carrier internalization, consistent with roles for PKA- and Rho-dependent signaling in mediating the actions of amphetamines in dopamine neurons. Our observations have also suggested the existence of a novel intracellular target for amphetamines and suggest new cellular pathways to target in order to disrupt amphetamine action. In recent studies we have established that a G-protein coupled trace amine receptor (TAAR1) serves as a direct intracellular target for amphetamines in dopamine neurons. Using transgenic mouse lines lacking the TAAR1 receptor we have shown that the intracellular effects of amphetamine, including both the elevation in cAMP and the increased RhoA activity, depend absolutely upon TAAR1 activation. We have shown that the when activated by amphetamine within the cell, TAAR1 couples through a G-protein alpha subunit, known as G13 to activate RhoA and through another G-protein alpha subunit, Gs to increase cAMP,  Using a series of subcellularly-targeted genetic sensors to detect RhoA or cAMP activation, we have been able to demonstrate that TAAR1 signaling initiates in an intracellular membrane compartment that is within or very proximal to the endoplasmic reticulum. We have also observed that the same amphetamine-activated RhoA-dependent mechanism downregulates a glutamate transporter, EAAT3, present on the surface of dopamine neurons. We have identified the EAAT3 peptide sequence responsible for this regulation, generated a cell-permeant fusion protein that blocks internalization and have used it to explore the effects of amphetamine on excitatory neurotransmission in brain slices and in vivo, using targeted viral expression. These studies have provided new tools to distinguish the effects of amphetamine on dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling. We have also compared the effects of various amphetamine compounds on the activation of cellular signaling pathways. Comparison of the effects of methamphetamine on glutamate transport activity to those of amphetamine indicate that while both treatments lead to a loss of cell-surface EAAT3, the effects of methamphetamine are much broader and do not depend on the expression of the DAT. These findings provide an explanation for the broader, more detrimental effects of methamphetamine: unlike amphetamine, methamphetamine has the capacity to alter EAAT3 surface expression and regulate excitatory neurotransmission, not only in dopamine neurons, but also in many other neuronal cell types within the brain. In other studies, we have shown that G-protein beta-gamma subunits released when G-protein-coupled receptors are activated bind directly to the DAT and enhance dopamine efflux in cultured cells and in vivo. Using cell permeable peptide fragments and mutagenesis of the DAT we have been able to define the transporter domains required for this interaction and to develop structural models for how this interaction may facilitate DA efflux by the transporter. Our work has demonstrated that release of G-beta-gamma subunits triggered by endogenous receptor activation is sufficient to enhance DA efflux in cultured cells and neurons. Most recently we have shown that the G-beta-gamma subunit drives the transporter into a novel conformation that facilitates dopamine efflux through a novel pathway that appears distinct from the pathway for transport.Glutamate transporters (also known as excitatory amino acid transporters or EAATs) present at the surface of neurons and supporting glial cells regulate the extracellular concentration of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. By transporting glutamate back into the cell, these carrier proteins prevent glutamate from reaching toxic levels and also limit the extent and duration of transmitter signaling during glutamatergic neurotransmission. These carriers have an additional function in that they possess an anion channel activity that can regulate cellular excitability, which enables them to serve as sensors of glutamate levels outside the cell. Our laboratory has used site-directed mutagenesis, sulfhydryl modification, and chemical cross-linking approaches together with biochemical, and electrophysiological analyses of the mammalian carriers to examine the structural domains required for substrate transport and ion permeation. Recent work has been directed at understanding the mechanism and structural basis of anion channel activation.  We have constructed a computational model of a glutamate transporter isoform, EAAT4,  which includes the cytoplasmic C-terminus. Our model suggests potential interactions between charged residues in the C-terminus and in a conserved region of transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) that may be relevant to function. We first tested this hypothesis using electrophysiological recordings in Xenopus oocytes expressing different point mutations in the two domains and using C-terminal truncations. Our preliminary results demonstrated that truncation of the full C-terminus disrupts channel gating, drives the channel into an open state and significantly reduces glutamate transport, suggesting that the C-terminal domain and its potential interaction with TM3 may be critical for the structural coupling between substrate transport and anion channel opening. To further validate the possibility that the C-terminal-TM3 interaction regulates the coupling between substrate transport and channel gating, we designed cell-permeable peptides that correspond to both regions and applied different concentrations of either peptide to oocytes expressing the full-length WT EAAT4. Our hypothesis was that these peptides would compete with and disrupt the C-terminal-TM3 interaction in a manner similar to the C-terminal truncation. Indeed, application of either peptide to EAAT4-exressing oocytes yielded results identical to the phenotype observed with the truncation mutants: glutamate-independent currents consistent with an open channel state and a reduced transport activity. These interfering peptides now provide new tools to address the structural basis for the coupling between anion channel opening and substrate translocation.

Our objective is to test regional rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) as a potential biomarker in a novel transgenic rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (TgF344-AD) (Cohen et al., 2013). TgF344-AD rats express mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1deltaE9) genes, each of which are independent causes of early-onset familial AD. The model recapitulates the human disease including age-dependent cerebral amyloidosis that precedes tauopathy, gliosis, apoptotic loss of neurons in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and cognitive disturbance. In this transgenic model we will determine the time course of changes in rCPS and correlate such changes with the time courses of deposition of amyloid-beta, the appearance of brain atrophy and the deterioration of performance on learning and memory tasks. If rCPS proves to be a good biomarker for the process of degeneration in AD, it could be useful to detect the early stages of the disease in human subjects, to track the progression of the disease, and to provide an objective and quantitative measure the efficacy of treatments being tested.

During the 2018 funding period, we completed analysis of studies of rCPS with the autoradiographic L-1-C-14leucine method in cohorts of WT and TgF344-AD at six, 14, and 18 months of age. In these animals, we also measured activity by means of open field behavior, memory by means of the T-maze, olfaction by means of the buried food task, and sleep duration. The analyses of behavioral studies were also completed during this funding period. In a separate cohort of animals studied longitudinally we measured rCPS with the L-1-C-11leucine PET method. We are preparing a manuscript reporting results of these studies.

The Developmental Neurogenomics Unit (DNU) is dedicated to better understanding the biology of childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders in ways that might ultimately help to improve disease prediction, detection and treatment. Together with our collaborators, we work towards this goal in two mutually-informative ways.First, we use large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging datasets to study the architecture of brain development in healthy volunteers. By modeling how neuroimaging measures of the human brain vary with age, sex and behavior in health, we hope to advance basic developmental neuroscience while also providing a data-driven way of selecting neuroimaging measures that should be prioritized for study in atypically developing groups.Second, we use a genetics-first strategy to study the relationship between atypical brain development and neuropsychiatric symptoms. This effort involves gathering deep-phenotypic data (spanning measures of gene expression, brain structure/function, psychophysiology, cognition and behavior) in diverse genetic disorders which all increase risk for neuropsychiatric impairment. Guided by knowledge of typical development, we harness these clinical data to empirically dissect the diverse biological pathways that can contribute to the emergence of neuropsychiatric syndromes.Cross-cutting themes of special interest within our Unit include sex differences, allometry, and structure-function relationships within the central nervous system.

This work is conducted under protocol 89-M-0006 (NCT00001246), and falls into two broad research themes:Theme 1: Studies of behavior and brain organization in typically-developing groupsWork in this theme uses large-scale neuroimaging studies in health to advance our basic understanding of human brain organization, and guide the selection and application of imaging phenotypes for disease studies. We have emphasized structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) because it offers intermediate in vivo phenotypes that can be reliably measured at scale, and are highly heritable, developmentally dynamic, sensitive to disease states, and amenable to translational study in mice.During the last year, we have published work in three main areas. First, we have sought to distill the large space of modern sMRI phenotypes by combining information from several distinct features of cortical anatomy. We have shown that the resulting individual-level brain networks (which are derived from conventional sMRI) can: capture cortical microarchitecture, predict >40% normative variance in IQ and provide a validated means of decoding neuroimaging maps from patients. Second, we have modeled major sources of variance in human brain anatomy, with a focus on total brain size. By detailing the scaling norms that couple size and shape in human brain, we have (i) improved detection and interpretation of changes associated with sex and neurodevelopmental disorders and (ii) defined a high-cost integrative brain system that is hyperexpanded in larger brains and vulnerable to neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, we have developed new analytic methods for quantifying the degree of spatial convergence between different cortical maps. These new tools will make it easier to integrate different views of cortical organization.Theme 2: Deep phenotypic studies of participants with sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes (SCAs)Work in this theme seeks to understand brain and behavioral changes in patients with genetically defined neurodevelopmental disorders  focusing on sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes (SCAs) in particular. Collectively, these studies are designed to expand on past work in SCA by gathering more comprehensive measures of brain structure and function, as well as providing more fine-grained information regarding the cognitive and behavioral variations that can be seen in SCA. These data will ultimately help to better define the developmental risks and resiliencies associated with X- and Y-chromosome dosage variation in humans and identify neurobiological systems that might underpin these associations. We hope these insights will (i) improve accurate public and professional awareness of SCAs, (ii) help clinicians provide more targeted assessment and counseling to patients and families with SCA, and (iii) begin to identify biological markers with the potential to ultimately improve assessment, prediction and treatment of neurodevelopmental issues in SCA. More broadly, this work in the specific case of SCA will shed light on (i) the principles that organize genetic influences on brain and behavior in the context of neuropsychiatric impairment, and (ii) sex chromosome contributions to sex differences in the brain, which are relevant for understanding the well-documented male bias in risk for neurodevelopmental disorders more generally.During the last year, we have published work in two main areas. First, we have used in vivo structural neuroimaging to detail how variations in X- and Y-chromosome dosage can shape folding of the cortical sheet  a process that provides critical insight into very early phases of human brain development. Together with our other clinical neuroimaging studies, these findings help to pinpoint when and where genetic causes of neurodevelopmental difficulties can impact brain development. Second, to identify potential molecular bases for observed SCA effects, we have published the first study to systematically examine how X- and Y-chromosome dosage shape genome structure and function in humans. By modeling these effects in tissue from patients, we hope to identify root causes for the changes in brain and behavior that accompany different genetic forms of neurodevelopmental difficulties.

In susceptible subjects, stress can lead to prolonged negative emotional states and pathological conditions such as anxiety disorders and major depression, both of which impair quality of life and are prevalent in society. Unfortunately, the precise circuit and cellular mechanisms that govern stress susceptibility remain unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, the Unit on the Neurobiology of Affective Memory is testing the prediction that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a midline thalamic structure that is readily activated by both physical and psychological stressors, controls animals susceptibility to stress and thereby shapes both adaptive (appropriate) and maladaptive (inappropriate) behavioral responses to stress. To achieve its scientific mission, our unit incorporates an interdisciplinary approach which includes: behavioral analyses, electrophysiology, optogenetics, in vivo imaging and mouse genetics.

","Dissecting the stress circuits of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus


","Unit on the Neurobiology of Affective Memory, NIMH","
During this fiscal year our group identified a major neuronal subpopulation of the PVT that expresses dopamine D2 receptors (D2R+) and whose excitability is significantly enhanced following stress. Importantly, we uncovered that this increase in excitability is the result of a stress-induced reduction in inhibitory synaptic transmission onto D2R+ neurons and requires activation of the D2R. Further assessment of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying disinhibition led to the observation that stress is associated with a prominent increase in the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the PVT. Surprisingly, this increase in dopamine was mediated by input from the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC). In agreement with this observation, chemogenetic and optogenetic inhibition of LC inputs to the PVT prevented the stress-induced disinhibition of the PVT. Altogether, our results define a cellular and circuit mechanism by which stress impacts the excitability of the PVT. Importantly, as demonstrated by our findings, the circuit and cellular processes uncovered by us shape behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to stress. Additional efforts are currently being placed in contrasting the activity patterns and functional roles of D2R+ and D2R- neurons of the PVT.

When we interact with the world, our actions are steered by complex decisions, memories, and social perceptions. It is these high-level aspects of cognition, often referred to as ""executive function,"" that in some sense make us most human. It is also these aspects that are most commonly affected in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Impairments in executive function, which are characteristic of patients with cognitive and mental disorders such as schizophrenia, persist long after acute symptoms subside, and severely compromise their psychosocial function and quality of life. These patients show a heterogeneous pattern of cognitive symptoms including inattention, impaired memory, poor decision-making, perseveration, impulsivity and social disinhibition. Moreover, similar impairments can often arise in the mind of a healthy individual when exposed to stress and fatigue, and are an inevitable unfortunate consequence of normal aging. Since a healthy mind is vital for promoting recovery and rehabilitation of many diseases, it is of paramount importance to understand the basic neurobiology of executive function to develop effective treatments and therapies. Ultimately, this understanding hinges upon embracing the details of a complex brain circuitry, and specifically the interaction between several key structures in the forebrain that govern executive function and emotion regulation. Thus, understanding the brain mechanisms underlying the control of executive and social behavior is of great value for both basic research and medicine. In the Section of Behavioral Neuroscience, our overarching goal is to elucidate the network of forebrain and midbrain structures that steer complex executive and socioemotional behavior in the intact brain, and the disruption of which commonly leads to cognitive ailments in brain disease, injury, and aging.

","Neural Circuits Underlying the Control of Executive and Emotional Behavior


","Section on Behavioral Neuroscience, NIMH","
In recent years, the work in my lab and that of other investigators has revealed that so-called prefrontal function, in fact, involves a broad network of areas including not only the prefrontal cortex but also the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and certain thalamic nuclei. These structures are anatomically connected in a particular way that is shared by rodents and by human and non-human primates, suggesting a mammalian network underlying the forebrain control of behavior. Its relation to the regulation of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, makes it central not only to understanding executive function, but also to schizophrenia and other disorders in humans. Our planned research is focused on understanding the functional anatomy of this circuitry. Our most recent studies have examined the function and connections of the hippocampus, which we now believe is at least as important as the prefrontal cortex for the inhibitory control of behavior. For example, like humans with disinhibitory symptoms (e.g., psychosis, alcohol use disorder, hyperkinesis), rats with hippocampal lesions are impulsive, antisocial, and emotionally unaroused. As this circuitry is central to our understanding of a wide range of human cognitive abilities and disorders, our future research will continue to investigate its underlying neurobiology, always retaining as its focal point the measurement and quantification of behavior.In the coming years, we will investigate the interaction between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, as well as their convergent projections onto the nucleus accumbens, in certain types of decision-making behavior. Drawing from our toolbox of ablation, pharmacological blockade, and cell-type specific suppression or stimulation using genetically encoded agents, we will attempt to understand the specific types of decisions served by different pathways. For example, we recently found that some types of decisions, particularly those involving time, critically and specifically depend on the interaction between the ventral hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens (Abela et al., European J. Neurosci, 2015). For such decisions, the prefrontal cortex appears to play a relatively minor role. At the same time, the hippocampus works together with the prefrontal cortex in other categories of decisions, such as those requiring the inhibition of a prepotent response (Abela et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2013). Neurotransmitter and neuropeptide levels are known to selectively modulate the nature of this hippocampal contribution. For example, we were able to improve decision-making skills in control rats by pharmacologically stimulating the alpha-2a-receptors directly in the ventral hippocampus, whereas stimulating dopamine D1 receptors had no such effect (Abela and Chudasama, Psychopharm. 2014). This modulation of cognitive decision-making may be related to the successful use of noradrenergic stimulants to relieve symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, where the site of action is presumed to be in the prefrontal cortex but never the hippocampus. In the past year, we have further explored the role of noradrenaline in cognitive function by focusing specifically on neuropeptides like Galanin and Neuropeptide Y, which are co-released with noradrenaline. Galanin receptors are highly expressed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, and our preliminary data suggest that Galanin receptor 1 mediated neurotransmission in these areas modulate impulse control mechanisms. Further experiments targeting galanin receptor 1 specific cells in the hippocampus will provide insight into how temporal lobe structures interact with the prefrontal cortex to optimize behavioral control. We thus plan to investigate the contribution of the hippocampus more specifically using cell-type specific inactivation. For this, we plan to combine behavioral testing with optogenetic methods using a cre-dependent virus under the control of a galanin receptor 1 promotor. This reversible manipulation approach will allow us to gauge the relative contributions of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and other related structures such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, to different types of cognitive decisions, with a high level of precision at both the behavioral and circuitry level. Understanding this interplay, as well as the effects of pharmacological agents in normalizing the contribution of these circuits, is a critical component of our research agenda that can have a direct clinical impact. In addition to the hippocampus, the thalamus has been increasingly recognized as contributing not only to the transmission of sensory and movement-related signals but also to aspects of executive function. This is particularly true of its midline nuclei, most of which have not been studied in great detail. We recently tracked putative pathways through the thalamus from the prefrontal and limbic cortex to the hippocampus using a polysynaptic virus (Prasad and Chudasama, J. Neurosci. 2013). We found that different regions of the hippocampus received input from different thalamic nuclei, which in turn received input from different cortical structures. This finding raised the question as to whether the midline thalamus is an important hub in frontotemporal circuitry, and by extension, to what extent is it a critical contributor to executive function? This question became more pressing in light of recent findings from our laboratory that ablation of one of these principal relay nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, leads to significant changes in executive behavior. Specifically, and somewhat paradoxically, we found that lesions to this structure improved animals capacity to perform on cognitive tasks by making them intensely focused, less impulsive and highly motivated (Prasad et al., 2017).In the past year, to get a better understanding of how the thalamus interacts with frontal and temporal structures, we conducted a series of anatomical studies to trace the connections of different thalamic structures using neurotrophic viruses such as pseudorabies (PRV), an alpha herpesvirus. These viruses are self-amplifying neuronal markers of polysynaptic neural connectivity and therefore have the capacity to delineate circuits or pathways of connected neurons by expressing fluorescent tags such as red dTomato (PRV-614) or green fluorescent protein (PRV-152) at each synaptically connected neuron. Our preliminary work has identified a topographical arrangement of cortical connections of the dorsal and ventral midline thalamic structures suggesting that the so-called non-specific midline thalamus is very specific in how it interacts with different brain regions. The behaviors following lesions of the prefrontal cortex, nucleus reuniens, and hippocampus underscore the fact that the control of executive behavior involves a broad network of structures, some of which lie outside the cortex and even outside of the telencephalon. Based on known connections and neuropharmacology, we anticipate that our understanding of this network will continue to expand and include additional brain structures, for example, particular nuclei in the hypothalamus and the septum. In fact, some preliminary neuroanatomical data shows that the ventral lateral portion of the lateral septum receives substantial input from ventral hippocampus.  Of particular interest is the high density of androgen receptors present in the hippocampus. Given the prominent role of androgen in hippocampal structure and function, we are particularly interested in the septohippocampal system in cognitive and emotional development.

When we interact with the world, our actions are steered by complex decisions, memories, and social perceptions. It is these high-level aspects of cognition, often referred to as ""executive function,"" that in some sense make us most human. It is also these aspects that are most commonly affected in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Impairments in executive function, which are characteristic of patients with cognitive and mental disorders such as schizophrenia, persist long after acute symptoms subside, and severely compromise their psychosocial function and quality of life. These patients show a heterogeneous pattern of cognitive symptoms including inattention, impaired memory, poor decision-making, perseveration, impulsivity and social disinhibition. Moreover, similar impairments can often arise in the mind of a healthy individual when exposed to stress and fatigue, and are an inevitable unfortunate consequence of normal aging. Since a healthy mind is vital for promoting recovery and rehabilitation of many diseases, it is of paramount importance to understand the basic neurobiology of executive function to develop effective treatments and therapies. Ultimately, this understanding hinges upon embracing the details of a complex brain circuitry, and specifically the interaction between several key structures in the forebrain that govern executive function and emotion regulation. Thus, understanding the brain mechanisms underlying the control of executive and social behavior is of great value for both basic research and medicine. In the Section of Behavioral Neuroscience, our overarching goal is to elucidate the network of forebrain and midbrain structures that steer complex executive and socioemotional behavior in the intact brain, and the disruption of which commonly leads to cognitive ailments in brain disease, injury, and aging. 

In recent years, the work in my lab and that of other investigators has revealed that so-called prefrontal function, in fact, involves a broad network of areas including not only the prefrontal cortex but also the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and certain thalamic nuclei. These structures are anatomically connected in a particular way that is shared by rodents and by human and non-human primates, suggesting a mammalian network underlying the forebrain control of behavior. Its relation to the regulation of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, makes it central not only to understanding executive function, but also to schizophrenia and other disorders in humans. Our planned research is focused on understanding the functional anatomy of this circuitry. Our most recent studies have examined the function and connections of the hippocampus, which we now believe is at least as important as the prefrontal cortex for the inhibitory control of behavior. For example, like humans with disinhibitory symptoms (e.g., psychosis, alcohol use disorder, hyperkinesis), rats with hippocampal lesions are impulsive, antisocial, and emotionally unaroused. As this circuitry is central to our understanding of a wide range of human cognitive abilities and disorders, our future research will continue to investigate its underlying neurobiology, always retaining as its focal point the measurement and quantification of behavior.In the coming years, we will investigate the interaction between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, as well as their convergent projections onto the nucleus accumbens, in certain types of decision-making behavior. Drawing from our toolbox of ablation, pharmacological blockade, and cell-type specific suppression or stimulation using genetically encoded agents, we will attempt to understand the specific types of decisions served by different pathways. For example, we recently found that some types of decisions, particularly those involving time, critically and specifically depend on the interaction between the ventral hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens (Abela et al., European J. Neurosci, 2015). For such decisions, the prefrontal cortex appears to play a relatively minor role. At the same time, the hippocampus works together with the prefrontal cortex in other categories of decisions, such as those requiring the inhibition of a prepotent response (Abela et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2013). Neurotransmitter and neuropeptide levels are known to selectively modulate the nature of this hippocampal contribution. For example, we were able to improve decision-making skills in control rats by pharmacologically stimulating the alpha-2a-receptors directly in the ventral hippocampus, whereas stimulating dopamine D1 receptors had no such effect (Abela and Chudasama, Psychopharm. 2014). This modulation of cognitive decision-making may be related to the successful use of noradrenergic stimulants to relieve symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, where the site of action is presumed to be in the prefrontal cortex but never the hippocampus. In the past year, we have further explored the role of noradrenaline in cognitive function by focusing specifically on neuropeptides like Galanin and Neuropeptide Y, which are co-released with noradrenaline. Galanin receptors are highly expressed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, and our preliminary data suggest that Galanin receptor 1 mediated neurotransmission in these areas modulate impulse control mechanisms. Further experiments targeting galanin receptor 1 specific cells in the hippocampus will provide insight into how temporal lobe structures interact with the prefrontal cortex to optimize behavioral control. We thus plan to investigate the contribution of the hippocampus more specifically using cell-type specific inactivation. For this, we plan to combine behavioral testing with optogenetic methods using a cre-dependent virus under the control of a galanin receptor 1 promotor. This reversible manipulation approach will allow us to gauge the relative contributions of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and other related structures such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, to different types of cognitive decisions, with a high level of precision at both the behavioral and circuitry level. Understanding this interplay, as well as the effects of pharmacological agents in normalizing the contribution of these circuits, is a critical component of our research agenda that can have a direct clinical impact. In addition to the hippocampus, the thalamus has been increasingly recognized as contributing not only to the transmission of sensory and movement-related signals but also to aspects of executive function. This is particularly true of its midline nuclei, most of which have not been studied in great detail. We recently tracked putative pathways through the thalamus from the prefrontal and limbic cortex to the hippocampus using a polysynaptic virus (Prasad and Chudasama, J. Neurosci. 2013). We found that different regions of the hippocampus received input from different thalamic nuclei, which in turn received input from different cortical structures. This finding raised the question as to whether the midline thalamus is an important hub in frontotemporal circuitry, and by extension, to what extent is it a critical contributor to executive function? This question became more pressing in light of recent findings from our laboratory that ablation of one of these principal relay nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, leads to significant changes in executive behavior. Specifically, and somewhat paradoxically, we found that lesions to this structure improved animals capacity to perform on cognitive tasks by making them intensely focused, less impulsive and highly motivated (Prasad et al., 2017).In the past year, to get a better understanding of how the thalamus interacts with frontal and temporal structures, we conducted a series of anatomical studies to trace the connections of different thalamic structures using neurotrophic viruses such as pseudorabies (PRV), an alpha herpesvirus. These viruses are self-amplifying neuronal markers of polysynaptic neural connectivity and therefore have the capacity to delineate circuits or pathways of connected neurons by expressing fluorescent tags such as red dTomato (PRV-614) or green fluorescent protein (PRV-152) at each synaptically connected neuron. Our preliminary work has identified a topographical arrangement of cortical connections of the dorsal and ventral midline thalamic structures suggesting that the so-called non-specific midline thalamus is very specific in how it interacts with different brain regions. The behaviors following lesions of the prefrontal cortex, nucleus reuniens, and hippocampus underscore the fact that the control of executive behavior involves a broad network of structures, some of which lie outside the cortex and even outside of the telencephalon. Based on known connections and neuropharmacology, we anticipate that our understanding of this network will continue to expand and include additional brain structures, for example, particular nuclei in the hypothalamus and the septum. In fact, some preliminary neuroanatomical data shows that the ventral lateral portion of the lateral septum receives substantial input from ventral hippocampus.  Of particular interest is the high density of androgen receptors present in the hippocampus. Given the prominent role of androgen in hippocampal structure and function, we are particularly interested in the septohippocampal system in cognitive and emotional development.

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Section on Developmental Genetic Epidemiology's Population-Based Epidemiologic Research is focused on two broad goals: first, to ultimately contribute toward the prevention of mental disorders by examining features of onset, risk factors, and course; and second, to inform progress towards a valid psychiatric nosology by investigating the boundaries and overlap between psychiatric disorders. The specific aims of our population-based research are to: 1) identify the prevalence, risk factors, symptom patterns, and comorbidity of the spectrum of mood disorders in adults and children; 2) evaluate patterns of mental and physical comorbidity; and 3) examine continuity, course, and outcome of mood and comorbid mental and physical disorders.These goals are achieved through analyses of multiple, diverse population-based data sources: 1) the Adolescent Supplement of the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS-A), the first nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents (10,123 participants) assessing a broad range of emotional, behavioral and substance use disorders; 2) the Cohort Study of Lausanne (CoLaus/PsyCoLaus) on Cardiovascular Diseases and Depression, a large study of the population of Lausanne, Switzerland,  with longitudinal data on a large population-based sample of 3,719 adults who underwent a comprehensive somatic, mental, biochemical and genetic investigation in order to prospectively study the association between cardiovascular disease/cardiovascular risk factors and mental disorders; 3) the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort Study (PNC), a large primary care sample of 10,000 youth ages 8-22 who had been seen in the Pediatrics Department; 4) the Zurich Cohort Study, a 30 year longitudinal study of 591 individuals from the canton of Zurich, Switzerland; and 5) the National Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), one of the largest U.S. epidemiologic samples of adults, with 3 waves of interviews now completed.

","Section on Developmental Genetic Epidemiology, NIMH","
During the past year, we have used NCS-A data to investigate the lifetime prevalence of mental disorder and mental health service use among adolescents by immigrant generation and racial/ethnic minority status, and found that some groups of adolescents are at greater risk for mental disorder than third and greater generation non-Hispanic white adolescents, while other groups are at lower risk. Importantly, mental health service use was less common among immigrant and minority adolescents controlling for disorder presence, indicating a disparity in treatment availability or utilization (Georgiades et al, 2018). We also examined the influence of adolescent-rated parenting style on the prevalence of mental disorders and found that high ratings of parental care were associated with reduced risk of a number of mental disorders, while high ratings of parental control were associated with increased risk (Eun et al, 2017). We also assessed associations between engagement in regular physical activity and adolescent mental disorder (He et al, in press). Findings indicated that physical activity was associated with lower odds of mood disorder and psychological distress, but higher odds of alcohol use disorder and eating disorder. The NCS-A is the sole source of U.S. national estimates of the prevalence of a comprehensive array of mental disorders in adolescents, which is why it continues to be a valuable scientific resource despite the fact that it was conducted over 10 years ago. Recent claims in the media of a dramatic increase in the prevalence of mental health problems among U.S. youth prompted us to publish an editorial clarifying that there is, in fact, little evidence to back such claims (Merikangas 2018). Complicating this issue is the lack of recent national U.S. data that would allow for a reliable comparison of rates. There is a clear need for the collection of such information for service planning as well as for research into biologic, genetic, and environmental influences on the occurrence of mental disorders in youth.Longitudinal studies have the potential to shed light not only on causes of disorder, but on the underlying nature of mental health and illness. In collaboration with our colleagues in Zurich, we used data from the 30-year Zurich Cohort Study to demonstrate the existence of a subthreshold mania syndrome among about one-fifth of members of the general population who have MDD (Angst et al, 2018). Those with the mania syndrome were more similar to those with clinical Bipolar Disorder (BPD) in terms of family history of mania, onset and course of illness, cyclothymic temperament, and comorbidity, than they were to those with pure MDD. Because the presence of subthreshold mania may increase risk for future manic disorder, early identification of those with subthreshold mania syndromes could help prevent progression to severe disorder. In addition to complications stemming from the underlying dimensionality of mania and depression, treatment and research in BPD is hindered by ethnic and cultural homogeneity among research participants and racial disparities in treatment access and provision. Therefore, with colleagues at the Mayo Clinic, we undertook a descriptive review of the literature to understand racial differences and diagnostic disparities in BPD, comparing African Americans to those of European ancestry (Akinhanmi et al, 2018). A number of studies have reported clinical misdiagnosis of black patients as well as differences in treatment quality, with implications for the disparity in illness course and burden. In addition, genetic studies of BPD often exclude participants not of European descent, which limits the impact of genetic discoveries. We concluded that increased effort is needed by the research community to understand the origins of such disparities and to increase representation of non-European populations in genetic and psychiatric research.In our collaboration with researchers from the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study in Switzerland, we evaluated the longitudinal and bidirectional association between mood disorders and levels of inflammatory markers and found that the atypical subtype of depression at baseline was associated with increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein at follow-up, whereas inflammation at baseline was not a risk factor for subsequent mood disorders (Glaus et al, 2017). Similarly, we analyzed the association between anxiety disorders and inflammation and we found that anxiety disorders at baseline (in particular agoraphobia) were associated with a steeper increase of hsCRP levels over the follow-up period. Moreover, there was no evidence for chronic low-grade inflammation as a predictor of future anxiety disorders (Glaus et al, 2017). These findings suggest that inflammation may be a consequence, but not a predictor of mental disorders. A current issue in mental health research is the need for transdiagnostic approaches to studying mental illness and brain development. Toward this end, we have been active in the development and establishment of the Child Mind Institute's Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study and have recently published a description of the HBN project goals, plan, and protocols (Alexander et al, 2017). The HBN will serve as a resource for researchers in the field who wish to tackle transdiagnostic research questions related to mental health in children and youth.Public Health Impact:The NCS-A study was the first with comprehensive domains of emotional and behavior disorders in a nationally representative sample of U.S. youth, and the results have had significant public health impact. The investigation of risk factors during development, which the NCS-A makes possible, is extremely important in mental health because many cases of mental disorder first arise during or prior to young adulthood and because brain development is implicated in the etiology of many mental disorders. The Zurich Cohort Study is an extremely valuable data source, as it is the longest community-based longitudinal study in which participants were enrolled at the beginning of adulthood. The detailed phenomenology collected as part of that study enables us to conduct research that informs our understanding of the nature of mental disorders, which may ultimately impact psychiatric treatment and research. Our work on the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study has substantial potential for public health impact because it combines information regarding cardiovascular risk factors and mental disorders in a longitudinal study. Our recent work represents only the beginning of a research program that we hope will help to tease apart the longitudinal relationships between physical and mental health in the population.Future Plans:We are currently focusing on mental disorders and other health related outcomes in relation to: 1) physical illnesses, 2) environmental exposures such as noise and light, 3) residential and school mobility, 4) peer and family social network characteristics, 5) lifestyle factors such as physical activity and sleep, 6) neighborhood and school-level exposures, and 7) biomarkers and health risk factors. Importantly, in the next year we plan to begin establishing a database of existing studies in child and adolescent psychiatric epidemiology to facilitate collaborations across the discipline. This will serve as a resource for the entire field and encourage continued use of these valuable existing data sources in order to maximize their scientific utility. Similarly, we plan to continue working with investigators of the HBN to plan completion of the study and dissemination of data to the scientific community. We also plan to analyze this data in-house to address questions regarding the role of child and adolescent development in the etiology of mental disorder.

The salience of motor activity as a core feature of bipolar disorder (BPD) has led us to devote substantial effort to the development of standardized procedures for its assessment, as well as to gain understanding of its biologic correlates and relationship with other core domains associated with mood and other disorders, and with human health in general.In collaboration with experts in analytic methods for actigraphy in the S.M.A.R.T. (Statistical Methods and Applications for Research in Technology) group in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Section on Developmental Genetic Epidemiology at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has established a collaborative activity network of more than ten sites entitled Motor Activity Research Consortium for Health (mMARCH).  The five core sites involved include: 1) the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus Study in Lausanne, Switzerland (Martin Preisig, MD, MPH; Peter Vollenweider, MD); 2) the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) at VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, Netherlands (Brenda Penninx, PhD; Femke Lamers, PhD); 3) the Youth Mental Health Clinic at the Brain & Mind Research Institute (BMRI) in Campbelltown, Sydney, Australia (Ian Hickie, MD); 4) the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Project in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (Nick Martin, PhD; Margie Wright, PhD); and 5) the NIMH Family Study of Affective and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders (NIMH Family Study) in Bethesda, MD (Kathleen Merikangas, PhD).  The core group selected the GENEActiv Device (Activinsights Ltd., geneactiv.org) to measure actigraphy, and most sites also include ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The overarching goal is to standardize methods and analytic approaches to investigate associations between motor activity, mood, and related disorders. The specific aims are to: 1) develop standard procedures for study administration, data management, and analyses of actigraphy data; 2) conduct cross-site and meta/mega analyses in order to increase power and cross validate common study questions; 3) develop and pilot collection of supplementary information using electronic or paper and pencil diary data; and 4) facilitate joint analyses of data to address topics defined by thematic subgroups (mood disorders, substance abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, genetic risk factors, sleep, physical health conditions, circadian rhythms, development, and inter-relationships of sleep, activity, eating, emotion, etc.).

There is growing interest in studying the environmental, biologic and genetic correlates of the components of motor activity as well as the relationships between motor activity with sleep, exercise, mood, and cognitive functioning. Aggregation of the findings across these studies is complicated by the substantial differences in both the study goals, procedures and statistical methods. There is a need for greater coordination across studies in the procedures and analytic methods that can consider advances in analysis of functional data. For example, in a recent mMARCH collaboration, experts from the S.M.A.R.T. and NIMH groups provided analytical guidance for an NIH study that used GENEActiv to characterize the differences of physical activity mean and variability in healthy individuals between daytime and nighttime periods for lower and upper extremities (Ramirez et al, 2018).  We have devoted the past year to analyses of the findings of the actigraphy and electronic diary, and their combination. We have used multiple analytic approaches to characterize the actigraphy data including generalized estimating equations, mixed models, functional principal components analysis and functional on scalar regression models. We found that bipolar 1 (BPI) disorder was characterized by lower average and greater variability in motor activity (Shou et al, 2017), and that those with BPD have greater cross-domain reactivity across homeostatic regulatory systems of motor activity, sleep, mood and energy (Merikangas et al, in press). Additionally, we are also analyzing patterns of motor activity and their association with mood disorders. We found two main patterns (contrast between daytime and nighttime activity/sleep; and contrast activity during morning and afternoon) and people with BPI tend to have lower activity levels during the day compared to controls (Glaus et al, in preparation). Since the formation of the mMARCH initiative, we have presented findings at scientific meetings including the International Society for BPD Research in Washington, DC; the International Society for Affective Disorders in Amsterdam; the Gordon Conference on Cognition and Circadian Rhythms in Hong Kong; the Society for Biological Psychiatry in San Diego, CA; the International Conference on Ambulatory Monitoring of Physical Activity and Movement in Bethesda, MD; the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Hollywood, FL; the World Psychiatric Association - Epidemiology and Public Health Section in New York, NY; the Johns Hopkins Annual Sleep and Circadian Research Day in Baltimore, MD; and several academic settings including Harvard Medical School, Weill-Cornell Medical School, and the University of Toronto.We have also done extensive analyses of the electronic diary data using EMA.

We have also employed a novel statistical technique to study the stability of emotional and attention states using fragmentation models (Johns et al, in press). We have now developed new EMA scripts that will be used in several sites in order to increase the generalizability of the samples and the power of these analyses. We are also analyzing sleep patterns and disorders as well as physical activity and eating patterns and their associations with mood disorder subtypes. This work has primarily been focused on data from the NIMH Family Study. However, we have also analyzed data from the Brisbane Twin Study, the Australian BMRI and the two Swiss studies (Family Study and CoLaus/PsyCoLaus). Our analytic group has conducted several webinars that instruct mMARCH site investigators on the procedures for processing, setting up data sets and conducting analyses of the GENEActiv actigraphy data. We have also convened an international team of biostatisticians and mathematicians directed by Drs. Zipunnikov and Shou that is working on algorithms for processing and analyzing the actigraphy data. The goal of this group is to simultaneously characterize multiple landmarks in circadian rhythms and will model inter- and intra-day interactions and dynamics in rest/activity and sleep patterns, thereby augmenting the available information and will empower the analytical framework uniformly applied across mMARCH sites.

",MH002954-03,106158,True,,,Kathleen R Merikangas; PhD,002954,622499.0,"
The salience of motor activity as a core feature of bipolar disorder (BPD) has led us to devote substantial effort to the development of standardized procedures for its assessment, as well as to gain understanding of its biologic correlates and relationship with other core domains associated with mood and other disorders, and with human health in general.In collaboration with experts in analytic methods for actigraphy in the S.M.A.R.T. (Statistical Methods and Applications for Research in Technology) group in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Section on Developmental Genetic Epidemiology at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has established a collaborative activity network of more than ten sites entitled Motor Activity Research Consortium for Health (mMARCH).  The five core sites involved include: 1) the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus Study in Lausanne, Switzerland (Martin Preisig, MD, MPH; Peter Vollenweider, MD); 2) the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) at VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, Netherlands (Brenda Penninx, PhD; Femke Lamers, PhD); 3) the Youth Mental Health Clinic at the Brain & Mind Research Institute (BMRI) in Campbelltown, Sydney, Australia (Ian Hickie, MD); 4) the Brisbane Adolescent Twin Project in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia (Nick Martin, PhD; Margie Wright, PhD); and 5) the NIMH Family Study of Affective and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders (NIMH Family Study) in Bethesda, MD (Kathleen Merikangas, PhD).  The core group selected the GENEActiv Device (Activinsights Ltd., geneactiv.org) to measure actigraphy, and most sites also include ecological momentary assessment (EMA). The overarching goal is to standardize methods and analytic approaches to investigate associations between motor activity, mood, and related disorders. The specific aims are to: 1) develop standard procedures for study administration, data management, and analyses of actigraphy data; 2) conduct cross-site and meta/mega analyses in order to increase power and cross validate common study questions; 3) develop and pilot collection of supplementary information using electronic or paper and pencil diary data; and 4) facilitate joint analyses of data to address topics defined by thematic subgroups (mood disorders, substance abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, genetic risk factors, sleep, physical health conditions, circadian rhythms, development, and inter-relationships of sleep, activity, eating, emotion, etc.).

There is growing interest in studying the environmental, biologic and genetic correlates of the components of motor activity as well as the relationships between motor activity with sleep, exercise, mood, and cognitive functioning. Aggregation of the findings across these studies is complicated by the substantial differences in both the study goals, procedures and statistical methods. There is a need for greater coordination across studies in the procedures and analytic methods that can consider advances in analysis of functional data. For example, in a recent mMARCH collaboration, experts from the S.M.A.R.T. and NIMH groups provided analytical guidance for an NIH study that used GENEActiv to characterize the differences of physical activity mean and variability in healthy individuals between daytime and nighttime periods for lower and upper extremities (Ramirez et al, 2018).  We have devoted the past year to analyses of the findings of the actigraphy and electronic diary, and their combination. We have used multiple analytic approaches to characterize the actigraphy data including generalized estimating equations, mixed models, functional principal components analysis and functional on scalar regression models. We found that bipolar 1 (BPI) disorder was characterized by lower average and greater variability in motor activity (Shou et al, 2017), and that those with BPD have greater cross-domain reactivity across homeostatic regulatory systems of motor activity, sleep, mood and energy (Merikangas et al, in press). Additionally, we are also analyzing patterns of motor activity and their association with mood disorders. We found two main patterns (contrast between daytime and nighttime activity/sleep; and contrast activity during morning and afternoon) and people with BPI tend to have lower activity levels during the day compared to controls (Glaus et al, in preparation). Since the formation of the mMARCH initiative, we have presented findings at scientific meetings including the International Society for BPD Research in Washington, DC; the International Society for Affective Disorders in Amsterdam; the Gordon Conference on Cognition and Circadian Rhythms in Hong Kong; the Society for Biological Psychiatry in San Diego, CA; the International Conference on Ambulatory Monitoring of Physical Activity and Movement in Bethesda, MD; the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Hollywood, FL; the World Psychiatric Association - Epidemiology and Public Health Section in New York, NY; the Johns Hopkins Annual Sleep and Circadian Research Day in Baltimore, MD; and several academic settings including Harvard Medical School, Weill-Cornell Medical School, and the University of Toronto.We have also done extensive analyses of the electronic diary data using EMA.

Major psychiatric disorders such as major depression remain a leading source of disability and economic burden world-wide. Psychotherapies and psychopharmacology are often helpful, but unfortunately many patients do not respond to available therapies. New developments in engineering and technology have opened the door to a new set of interventions with which to study and treat brain-based disorders that are not effectively managed with available treatments. Collectively, these neuromodulation tools apply energy to the brain, using electrical or magnetic fields, with the goal of studying brain function and of treating depression and other disabling conditions.The Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU) focuses on developing novel noninvasive neuromodulation tools, coupled with brain measurements via neurophysiology and neuroimaging, to measure and modulate neural plasticity for the study and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The NNU provides expertise in neuromodulation tools to support other NIH investigators, and we conduct research projects focused on advancing neuromodulation technologies to improve their utility and safety. Specifically, we develop novel stimulation paradigms and biomarker batteries to investigate brain-behavior relationships and to inform novel intervention development. Our team, spanning the fields of psychiatry, engineering, neuroscience and psychology, has expertise in electric field modeling, device and coil design for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), cognitive neuroscience trials employing image-guided neuromodulation, and the translational development of novel treatments in preclinical models, healthy volunteers, and clinical populations. As a service within the Multi-Modal Imaging Center directed by Dr. Bandettini, the Non-Invasive Neuromodulation service includes TMS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), TMS-compatible EEG (electroencephalography), and TMS/fMRI interleaving facilities. We supply state of the art TMS, tDCS, tACS, EEG, EMG (electromyography), frameless stereotaxy (neuronavigation), perturbation/physiology equipment and associated data processing pipelines to support NIH IRP investigators. Our mission is:1. to develop novel technology and stimulation paradigms for neuromodulation, and 2. to advance understanding of mechanisms of neuromodulation therapies, including the spatial, temporal, and contextual aspects of brain stimulation

","Non-invasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU)


","Unit on Non-invasive Neuromodulation, NIMH","
Work was conducted under clinical protocols NCT03065335 and NCT03289923.Major accomplishments for the NNU were the recruitment of additional staff, acquiring research data from our first subjects in our collaboration with the Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch (ETPB), launching our initial multimodal protocol in combined TMS and talk therapy, installation and testing of neuromodulation equipment, expanding our training of staff to include additional labs at NIH as a core function, writing of software to implement experiments and collect and process data, protocol development and launch of the Multimodal Brain Stimulation speaker series. We now have a fully functional noninvasive neuromodulation laboratory operating for use with human subjects installed in the inpatient unit in the Clinical Center which is actively enrolling subjects in IRB approved trials. Training in the safe and effective delivery of neuromodulation is one of our major functions as a Service within the Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging. We continue to provide in-service training on TMS safety, including hands-on training sessions covering the following procedures: Motor threshold determination, electromyography (EMG), Paired pulse TMS measures of cortical excitability, simultaneous TMS/EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials, Somatosensory evoked potentials, Paired Associative Stimulation (a paradigm which induces neural plasticity), TMS-Safety procedures, and the role of Nursing in TMS and patient management.Our projects fall into 3 themes: 1) measuring neuroplasticity, 2) modulating neuroplasticity, 3) modeling the effects of neuromodulation and mining multi-modal datasets to discover biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response. Our projects include:Theme I: Measuring NeuroplasticityMechanisms of Rapid Antidepressant Action collaboration with Drs. Zarate and Parko This project develops biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response through the addition of TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG and TMS-fMRI neuroplasticity measures to the existing intramural research program on ketamine. Concurrent fMRI-guided rTMS and cognitive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodeso This project (which also incorporates Theme II, below) uses MEG (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI, and TMS/EEG to measure brain network engagement and neuroplastic changes due to multimodal TMS/CBT in depressed adults.Theme II: Modulating NeuroplasticityWe are taking complementary approaches to modulating neuroplasticity: 1) seizure-induced neuroplasticity, 2) paired associative stimulation (PAS) and 3) novel tool development to extend the spatial and temporal specificity of noninvasive neuromodulation. Next generation seizure therapy collaboration with Drs. Zarate, Park, Bikson, Dattao Therapeutically induced seizures exert rapid antidepressant action and are robust inducers of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis. New technologies for focal seizure induction may improve the risk/benefit ratio by lowering cognitive side effects, and also provide the valuable scientific opportunity to examine common mechanisms across rapidly acting interventions such as ketamine. o This project involves optimization of seizure therapy dosing, through the study of individualized low amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST), comprised of focal seizure induction with minimal current exposure to improve tolerability of seizure therapy for depression. Cognitive Paired Associative Stimulation (C-PAS) o PAS has been shown to strengthen synaptic efficacy within a circuit through repeated co-activation and coincident firing. We extend that approach to activate a targeted neural circuit through cognitive task performance, and couple that with simultaneous focal neuromodulation to enhance plasticity, as a means of enhancing circuit function and improving the functional-specificity of neuromodulation action. One of our projects employs fMRI-guided TMS paired with a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression (in collaboration with Dr. Strauman). Another of our projects, being conducted in the form of a cooperative agreement (5U01AG050618) uses fMRI-guided TMS with simultaneous working memory training to enhance executive function in older adults (in collaboration with Drs. Appelbaum, Peterchev, and Cabeza).Noninvasive focal deep brain stimulation (nfDBS)o Noninvasive brain stimulation is either focal and superficial, or deep and broad. Its utility as a clinical and research tool hinges on the ability to improve the spatial and temporal aspects of targeting. These projects address innovative approaches to improve the spatial resolution of TMS at depth, to precisely target deep brain structures and distributed networks of interest. Transcranial direction current stimulation to reduce effects of nicotine withdrawal syndromeNIDA Protocol 12-DA-N474 (PI: E.A.Stein, collaborators: Betty Jo Salmeron, Sarah Aronson)Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal remain a major impediment for smokers trying to quit, with most quit attempts failing within the first week of abstinence when withdrawal symptoms are at their height. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. The goal is to investigate the effects of tDCS on modulating large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal. Neural mechanisms underlying noninvasive brain stimulation assisted motor skill learning in older adults.Closed-loop paired associative stimulationo The effects of noninvasive brain stimulation can be extremely variable across subjects.  One source of this variability is known to be the state of the brain at the time of stimulation.  One way of addressing this source of variability is to trigger the TMS when the brain is in an up-state or a down-state.  To accomplish this, real-time signal processing is utilized to analyze the EEG and predict where the brain oscillations will be milliseconds in advance.  The TMS trigger is controlled by the real-time hardware.Theme III: Modeling Neuroplasticity / Mining Multi-Modal DatasetsOur team comprises engineering expertise to perform in silico modeling of the spatial and temporal effects of neuromodulation on neuronal function, and to apply machine learning and graph theoretical approaches to data-mining and hypothesis generation to support the discovery of common mechanisms across rapidly acting antidepressant interventions.

Our team, spanning the fields of psychiatry, engineering, neuroscience and psychology, has expertise in electric field modeling, device and coil design for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), cognitive neuroscience trials employing image-guided neuromodulation, and the translational development of novel treatments in preclinical models, healthy volunteers, and clinical populations. As a service within the Multi-Modal Imaging Center directed by Dr. Bandettini, the Non-Invasive Neuromodulation service includes TMS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), TMS-compatible EEG (electroencephalography), and TMS/fMRI interleaving facilities. We supply state of the art TMS, tDCS, tACS, EEG, EMG (electromyography), frameless stereotaxy (neuronavigation), perturbation/physiology equipment and associated data processing pipelines to support NIH IRP investigators. Our mission is:1. to develop novel technology and stimulation paradigms for neuromodulation, and 2. to advance understanding of mechanisms of neuromodulation therapies, including the spatial, temporal, and contextual aspects of brain stimulation

Work was conducted under clinical protocols NCT03065335 and NCT03289923.Major accomplishments for the NNU were the recruitment of additional staff, acquiring research data from our first subjects in our collaboration with the Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch (ETPB), launching our initial multimodal protocol in combined TMS and talk therapy, installation and testing of neuromodulation equipment, expanding our training of staff to include additional labs at NIH as a core function, writing of software to implement experiments and collect and process data, protocol development and launch of the Multimodal Brain Stimulation speaker series. We now have a fully functional noninvasive neuromodulation laboratory operating for use with human subjects installed in the inpatient unit in the Clinical Center which is actively enrolling subjects in IRB approved trials. Training in the safe and effective delivery of neuromodulation is one of our major functions as a Service within the Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging. We continue to provide in-service training on TMS safety, including hands-on training sessions covering the following procedures: Motor threshold determination, electromyography (EMG), Paired pulse TMS measures of cortical excitability, simultaneous TMS/EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials, Somatosensory evoked potentials, Paired Associative Stimulation (a paradigm which induces neural plasticity), TMS-Safety procedures, and the role of Nursing in TMS and patient management.Our projects fall into 3 themes: 1) measuring neuroplasticity, 2) modulating neuroplasticity, 3) modeling the effects of neuromodulation and mining multi-modal datasets to discover biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response. Our projects include:Theme I: Measuring NeuroplasticityMechanisms of Rapid Antidepressant Action collaboration with Drs. Zarate and Parko This project develops biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response through the addition of TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG and TMS-fMRI neuroplasticity measures to the existing intramural research program on ketamine. Concurrent fMRI-guided rTMS and cognitive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodeso This project (which also incorporates Theme II, below) uses MEG (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI, and TMS/EEG to measure brain network engagement and neuroplastic changes due to multimodal TMS/CBT in depressed adults.Theme II: Modulating NeuroplasticityWe are taking complementary approaches to modulating neuroplasticity: 1) seizure-induced neuroplasticity, 2) paired associative stimulation (PAS) and 3) novel tool development to extend the spatial and temporal specificity of noninvasive neuromodulation. Next generation seizure therapy collaboration with Drs. Zarate, Park, Bikson, Dattao Therapeutically induced seizures exert rapid antidepressant action and are robust inducers of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis. New technologies for focal seizure induction may improve the risk/benefit ratio by lowering cognitive side effects, and also provide the valuable scientific opportunity to examine common mechanisms across rapidly acting interventions such as ketamine. o This project involves optimization of seizure therapy dosing, through the study of individualized low amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST), comprised of focal seizure induction with minimal current exposure to improve tolerability of seizure therapy for depression. Cognitive Paired Associative Stimulation (C-PAS) o PAS has been shown to strengthen synaptic efficacy within a circuit through repeated co-activation and coincident firing. We extend that approach to activate a targeted neural circuit through cognitive task performance, and couple that with simultaneous focal neuromodulation to enhance plasticity, as a means of enhancing circuit function and improving the functional-specificity of neuromodulation action. One of our projects employs fMRI-guided TMS paired with a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression (in collaboration with Dr. Strauman). Another of our projects, being conducted in the form of a cooperative agreement (5U01AG050618) uses fMRI-guided TMS with simultaneous working memory training to enhance executive function in older adults (in collaboration with Drs. Appelbaum, Peterchev, and Cabeza).Noninvasive focal deep brain stimulation (nfDBS)o Noninvasive brain stimulation is either focal and superficial, or deep and broad. Its utility as a clinical and research tool hinges on the ability to improve the spatial and temporal aspects of targeting. These projects address innovative approaches to improve the spatial resolution of TMS at depth, to precisely target deep brain structures and distributed networks of interest. Transcranial direction current stimulation to reduce effects of nicotine withdrawal syndromeNIDA Protocol 12-DA-N474 (PI: E.A.Stein, collaborators: Betty Jo Salmeron, Sarah Aronson)Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal remain a major impediment for smokers trying to quit, with most quit attempts failing within the first week of abstinence when withdrawal symptoms are at their height. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. The goal is to investigate the effects of tDCS on modulating large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal. Neural mechanisms underlying noninvasive brain stimulation assisted motor skill learning in older adults.Closed-loop paired associative stimulationo The effects of noninvasive brain stimulation can be extremely variable across subjects.  One source of this variability is known to be the state of the brain at the time of stimulation.  One way of addressing this source of variability is to trigger the TMS when the brain is in an up-state or a down-state.  To accomplish this, real-time signal processing is utilized to analyze the EEG and predict where the brain oscillations will be milliseconds in advance.  The TMS trigger is controlled by the real-time hardware.Theme III: Modeling Neuroplasticity / Mining Multi-Modal DatasetsOur team comprises engineering expertise to perform in silico modeling of the spatial and temporal effects of neuromodulation on neuronal function, and to apply machine learning and graph theoretical approaches to data-mining and hypothesis generation to support the discovery of common mechanisms across rapidly acting antidepressant interventions.

A major open question about brain function is how cortical neuronal activity is linked to behavioral decisions. Millions of neurons change their activity in response to even the smallest sensory stimulus. How does the brain use, or decode, these millions of neurons activity to generate a behavior? It might be that our brains average over many neurons, or decode only cells with specific properties. As an example, to make a decision on whether a visual edge has a particular orientation, it might be that the brain integrates information from all the cells that respond to the edge, or only a small number of cells that are most specific to that edge. Theoretical frameworks exist that can justify either possibility. To shed light on how the brain makes behavioral decisions using neuronal activity, we use optical and electrical methods in mice to record and perturb the activity of populations of neurons during behavior. We have developed mouse psychophysical behavioral assays that can accurately measure small changes in perceptual behavior. These assays are well-suited to examine the small behavioral changes that arise from changes in neurons' activity. We also draw on insights from machine learning, using how decoding works in artificial networks to form hypotheses about how the brain might decode activity. The combination of these methods can allow new examinations of the circuit basis of mental diseases like schizophrenia that lead to changes in perception.

In one project, we are examining how particular sets of neurons are chosen by the brain to guide decisions. Whenever humans or animals see sensory stimuli, many brain areas are activated. We hypothesize that there are particular representations particular patterns that are created in each brain area, some of which are optimized for decoding and some of which are optimized for other kinds of information processing. We are training mice to report perception of sets of visual stimuli which have decodable representations in different cortical regions. This work will shed light on which areas the brain decodes for behavior, and why it chooses those areas for decoding. In a second project, to understand how neuronal activity patterns give rise to behavior, we are changing the activity of populations of neurons with one-photon stimulation, and also of single neurons with two-photon stimulation.  This approach allows changes in neural activity patterns in mammals during behavior, and it opens the door to studying how animals' choices depend on patterns of neuronal activity. We have achieved stable psychophysical performance in mice in the laboratory, and collected data in which we use the instruments to evoke stimulation patterns. We hypothesize that the brain regards as similar, for behavioral decisions, many different patterns that share similar statistical structure. A third project is aimed at tracing the flow of information from one area to the next within the cerebral cortex to understand the circuits that underlie decoding. We are labeling both anatomically and functionally neurons that project among several visual cortical areas. By activating and inactivating these projections during behavior, we are measuring which projections are used in decision making.

Depression is the leading cause of disability among young people, and by the year 2030, it is projected to be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide (WHO, 2014). Rates of depression increase dramatically during adolescence: 20% of youths experience a major depressive episode before age 18 (Kessler et al., 1994;Beesdoet al., 2009), and five-year relapse rates approach 60% (Dunn & Goodyer, 2006). Longitudinal research suggests strong continuity of adolescent depression into adulthood, with persistent impairments in social and occupational functioning and markedly elevated risk of suicide attempts (Costello et al., 2002;Weissman et al., 1999). Yet, compared to many other medical conditions, we know little about the mechanisms underlying adolescent depression. In recent years, reward processing has emerged as a mechanism that could plausibly underlie several key behavioral and neural aberrations observed in depression (Treadway & Zald 2011; Whitton et al 2015). We pursue the following broad questions: 1)	What is the concordance of measures of reward processing in depression over time?2)	How does reward processing in depression compare to other common problems of childhood, such as anxiety and irritability?3)	How does reward processing interact with systems subserving sense of agency?4)	What can treatments tell us about reward processing and can they help us improve treatment of people with depression?

The unit on neurons, circuits and behavior (NCB) aims to bridge the gap between the neural activity in high-level visual processing areas in primate ventral cortical stream (e.g., inferior temporal cortex) and object recognition behavior. To do so, we will perturb brain activity using electrical microstimulation, optogenetics and drug microinjections and measure the effects of perturbation on the neural activity profile as well as a battery of psychophysical tasks. The goal is to separate the neural events that causally drive visual perception and behavior from those that are epiphenomenal.

The cerebral cortex is the largest and most complex part of the mammalian brain, consisting of diverse, highly interconnected cell types and areas that process and combine multiple streams of information. The computations taking place in cortex are essential for sensory perception, movement control, memory and cognition. In sensory cortices, information from the environment is integrated with past experiences and present contextual cues from which emerge percepts that lead to actions. The impairment of the communications among different cortical areas often leads to psychiatric disorders.Our research focuses specific circuits and neuronal types that enable internally-generated brain activity to interact with sensation, with emphasis on different types of cortical GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid) neurons. Although GABAergic neurons represent a minority of all cortical neurons, they potently control entire cortical activity. Our projects aim to delineate the functional connectivity among related brain areas, to identify the behavioral relevance of these circuits, to understand the computations these circuits perform, and to uncover their developmental specificity and plasticity. We use the rodent vibrissa-related sensorimotor system as a model system because the rodent vibrissa system is ecologically relevant, critical to the animals ability to navigate and engaged in goal-directed behavior. We apply a multidisciplinary approach that combines molecular and genetic techniques with electrophysiological, imaging, viral tracing, optogenetic, and pharmacogenetic methods, as well as behavioral methods.

Summary In order to understand the principles of long-range connectivity in cortical communication, our efforts have focused on the following two projects. Project 1: Functional connectivity of diverse long-range inputs to the primary somatosensory cortex.  To achieve a mechanistic understanding of the functional connectivity among different cortical areas, we have systematically examined the synaptic strength from different brain areas to diverse neuronal types in the primary somatosensory cortex, using electrophysiological methods combined with optogenetic tools and viral tracing methods. Our results suggest that sensory-related feedback information is transmitted to the primary sensory cortex by engaging PV (parvalbumin) GABAergic interneuron-mediated feedforward inhibition, while motor-related feedback information is propagated to S1 through VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide) GABAergic interneuron-mediated disinhibition. Thus, primary sensory cortex may parse information from diverse feedback projections by means of input area-dependent, preferential recruitment of specific types of GABAergic interneurons. Project 2: Circuit basis of functional diversity in pyramidal neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex The associative layer of cortex is the main cortical layer for cortical interaction. Neuronal activity in the associative layer of sensory cortex is highly heterogenous. The diverse subnetworks in the associative layer show correlated neuronal activity in relation to various aspects of the animals behavior. We hypothesize that dedicated streams of information impinge onto functionally relevant subnetworks, and these distinct subnetworks broadcast their information to different brain regions. To understand the circuit mechanism of functionally relevant subnetworks in sensory cortex, we have examined the activity of large neuronal populations together with multiple behavioral variables, using two-photon calcium imaging, optogenetics, anatomical tracing, and monosynaptic tracing methods. We are currently examining whether functionally relevant subnetworks are organized by their long-range projection targets  and constrained by specific long-range presynaptic networks and local GABAergic interneurons.

To understand the circuit mechanism of functionally relevant subnetworks in sensory cortex, we have examined the activity of large neuronal populations together with multiple behavioral variables, using two-photon calcium imaging, optogenetics, anatomical tracing, and monosynaptic tracing methods. We are currently examining whether functionally relevant subnetworks are organized by their long-range projection targets  and constrained by specific long-range presynaptic networks and local GABAergic interneurons.

The core of my section's work rests on an important discovery that we made a decade ago of a new class of photoreceptors in the retina, known as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). Before our discovery, the retina was thought to contain only rods and cones, the classical photoreceptors. We have been at the forefront of major discoveries in this field and will continue to define the retinal circuits and brain centers by which ipRGCs drive a variety of critical functions, which include circadian photoentrainment, sleep, mood, learning & memory and the pupillary light reflex. We have generated and will continue to generate multiple genetic mouse models, employ morphological and electrophysiological analyses and establish quantitative behavioral assays to reveal the neural circuitry, developmental pathways and in vivo functions of ipRGCs. These powerful complementary approaches will allow us to tackle exciting new directions on ipRGC functions in image formation, mood, learning and sleep. Collectively, our research will lead to a better understanding of how light influences our life and will inform light-based therapeutic measures to improve our well-being.The objectives of our section are fourfold: 1- Understand how the classical photoreceptors, rods and cones, interact with ipRGCs at the retinal level and how their combined light processing is signaled to the brain to influence light-dependent behaviors. 2- Define new sleep areas that are modulated by light input. 3- Decipher the neural pathways by which light influences mood and learning & memory. 4- Understand the developmental time course for the birth and maturation of ipRGCs. Combined, these objectives will afford us a better understanding of how environmental stimuli (in our case, light) interact with their cognate receptors (in our case, photoreceptors in the retina) to influence important behaviors for human health (in our case, sleep, mood and learning).

","Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms


","Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms, NIMH","
Research projects, Fiscal Year 2018, can be divided into four major areas listed below:1- The Development and the role of the SCN in regulating several output functionsThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is believed to influence circadian rhythms primarily by direct efferent connections with downstream brain regions. The SCN produces several neuropeptides including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin releasing peptide (Grp), prokineticin-2 (Prok2), and arginine-vasopressin (Avp). These neuropeptides are thought to synchronize cellular oscillators within the SCN. However, whether they are capable of entraining downstream oscillators is unclear. A major obstacle to the study of SCN neuropeptide functions in controlling downstream oscillators has been the availability of animal models that still have SCN synchrony but lack neuropeptide expression.In collaboration with Seth Blackshaw's lab, we have generated a mouse model that lacks the expression of major SCN neuropeptides but maintains synchronous cellular oscillations in the SCN. This allows us, for the first time, to specifically address the necessity and sufficiency of SCN neuropeptides in regulating circadian behaviors. In collaboration with Seth Blackshaw (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine), we conditionally deleted a LIM homeodomain transcription factor, Lhx1, specifically in the SCN (Six3-Cre;Lhx1lox/lox henceforth called Lhx1 mutant mice). We found that Lhx1-mutants exhibit a dramatic downregulation in the levels of the major SCN neuropeptides, Vip, Grp, Avp and Prok2. Notably, the maturation of SCN, the core SCN clock-work and clock-controlled gene expression are still preserved (Bedont et al., Cell Reports 2014). Lhx1-mutant mice exhibit modest deficits in the circadian output behavior of wheel running activity, but importantly, we observed profound deficits in sleep regulation by light (Bedont et al., Current Biology 2017). We will determine the necessity of the SCN neuropeptides in controlling sleep in future publications.2- Diversity and function of ipRGCsWe have generated genetically modified mouse lines to uncover the contribution of ipRGC subtypes and the corresponding brain circuits to the synchronization of the internal biological clock to the solar day. We have animals that either harbor only the SCN-projecting ipRGCs (Chen et al., Nature 2011) or lack the ipRGCs that project to the SCN (unpublished). This will allow us to determine the contribution of individual subtypes of ipRGCs to circadian photoentrainment and phase shifts. The phase of the circadian oscillator can be advanced or delayed by acute pulses of light, known as phase shifts. Our exciting preliminary data reveal that different populations of ipRGCs control phase delays versus phase advances in the circadian oscillator. This finding challenges the current view in the field that similar mechanisms underlie phase advances and phase delays, and that light has a simple ON/OFF effect on the clock. Future studies will determine which ipRGC populations are necessary for advances versus delays, and map the brain regions that are influenced by light to cause changes in the phase of the circadian oscillator.We recently made a startling discovery that a subpopulation of ipRGCs (200 M1-Brn3b-negative, which we called circadian photoreceptors) is critical for the development of the circadian clock as well as vision, although they do not project to visual centers (Chew et al., eLife 2017). An exciting hypothesis is that these 200 ipRGCs (Chen et al., Nature 2011) represent an evolutionary ancient photoreceptor class given their broad influence on several distinct behaviors (photoentrainment, development of the clock and vision as well as local pupillary light reflex). Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular and functional specification of this population in relation to other ipRGCs and conventional ganglion cells. Thus, we have started to examine the transcriptome and epigenetic marks of this population using our resources at NIMH. This project will provide the molecular handles to understand the ontogeny and the functional specialization of the 200 M1 ipRGCs in relation to other ipRGCs and conventional ganglion cells.3- Uncovering the retinal and brain circuits that allow light to influence mood and learning and memoryIt is well established that light therapy can be used to treat several types of major depression in humans. However, it has been hard to ascertain whether these effects of light are purely placebo effects. We recently discovered a new brain region that allows light to directly regulate mood in rodents. This new region is termed the perihabenular complex and it connects to several area in the brain essential for mood regulation such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens.4- Uncovering new brain areas that regulate sleepIn an exciting collaboration with Seth Blackshaw's lab, we found an undefined population, Lhx6-neuronal population of GABA neurons in the zona incerta regulate sleep (Liu, Nature 2017).Together, we will continue to break new ground about how light signaling from the environment regulates several functions that are essential for the well-being of humans.

","Multiple Scales of Stimulus Representation in the Human Brain


","Section on Neurocircuitry, NIMH","
During the past year, we have focused on 1) characterizing the representation of stimulus features in primary visual cortex and 2) studying how these representations interact with endogenous brain states, such as spatial attention and arousal.  1) Characterizing stimulus representations in human visual cortex. Stimulus orientation is one of the most basic stimulus features represented in primary visual cortex (V1). Yet, after more than 50 years of research, the representation of orientation is inadequately understood. Orientation-selective V1 neurons are organized at a fine spatial scale in a pseudo-periodic, columnar structure across the cortical surface. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have previously discovered an additional level of organization, a coarse-scale orientation bias in which each fMRI voxel in V1 exhibits an orientation preference that depends on the region of space that it represents.Over the past year, we have investigated the neural computations that give rise to the coarse-scale orientation bias. We developed a computational model of neural activity in V1. The modeling results indicate that three theoretically distinct neural mechanisms could give rise to the coarse-scale orientation bias: stimulus vignetting, neural gain fields, and asymmetric surround suppression.We tested predictions of the computational model using high-resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla (7T) under NCT00001360. We found that the coarse-scale orientation bias is entirely determined by stimulus vignetting, and that there was no evidence for fine-scale orientation biases in the fMRI measurements (Roth et al., eLife, 2018). Our results provide a framework for reinterpreting a wide-range of imaging results in the visual system.Our ongoing work on this topic has focused on two questions. First, we are applying these theoretical and empirical findings to guide studies of visual recovery following stroke. Second, we are using the computational model in conjunction with fMRI to measure visual surround suppression, which is an important step in characterizing excitatory/inhibitory interactions in the visual system. Our work on understanding neural computations in the intact visual system is vital in determining how these computations are altered in mental health and neurological disorders.2) Endogenous brain states.Visual perception arises from dynamic interactions between feedforward sensory information and top-down modulatory signals. In the past year, we have studied two types of top-down modulation. First, we used a novel spatial cuing protocol to isolate fMRI activity associated with endogenous spatial attention. We discovered specific sub-regions of the temporal-parietal junction are involved in directing attention to locations in space (Dugu et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2017).Second, we identified a type of brain activity that reflects the subject's general engagement in a task. This task-related activity contributes prominently to brain hemodynamic responses measured with fMRI, is independent of external visual stimuli, and instead reflects internal brain states. Task-related activity appears to be distinct from spatially-localized endogenous attention in that it is spatially global in cortex rather than retinotopically specific. This activity may be related to general arousal. We found that fluctuations in task-related brain activity correlate with fluctuations in behavioral performance. Our experiments in the past year have focused on simple visual discrimination tasks, and we have more recently begun to extend these experiments to investigate the relationship between task-related activity and task difficulty and reward processing. We are also collaborating with members of the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Core Facility at NIMH to use high resolution fMRI methods to test the hypothesis that task-related hemodynamic signals have a laminar profile that is distinct from that of spatial attention. Understanding the neural mechanisms of attention and global brain states has implications for the study of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

In the cerebral cortex, each excitatory cell receives thousands of synaptic inputs. A central question in neuroscience is how these inputs are summed to produce spiking outputs. For example, in primary sensory cortex, a particular sensory stimulus can evoke different numbers of spikes depending on the behavioral state of the animal, presumably reflecting one sort of summation change response gain variability. Theoretical work has characterized an array of input-summation processes that are potentially used by cortical networks, promising to explain generally how cortical networks respond to input. However, it has proven extremely difficult to obtain the experimental data needed to support and test this theoretical work, primarily because sensory stimuli generally affect neural activity within multiple brain regions, each of which could subsequently provide input to the area under study. Optogenetic stimulation, combined with sensory stimuli, can provide critical tests of these theoretical models.To understand how cortical neurons perform computation, we use a joint experimental and theoretical approach. We are measuring how mouse visual cortical neurons respond to combinations of optogenetic and visual input, and using network models to understand the circuit features that shape those input responses.

In one project, we reported results that shed light on input-output transformations in cortical networks.  We recorded spiking responses from visual cortex (V1) of awake mice of either sex while pairing sensory stimuli with optogenetic perturbation of excitatory and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons.  We found V1 neurons average responses were primarily additive (linear). We used a recurrent cortical network model to determine if these data, as well as past observations of nonlinearity, could be described by a common circuit architecture.  Simulations showed cortical input-output transformations can be changed from linear to sublinear with moderate (20%) strengthening of connections between inhibitory neurons, but this change away from linear scaling depends on the presence of feedforward inhibition.  Simulating a variety of recurrent connection strengths showed that, compared to when input arrives only to excitatory neurons, networks produce a wider range of output spiking responses in the presence of feedforward inhibition. In a second project, we are examining how the cortex controls the gain of responses by using a learning paradigm. Animals and humans improve their performance in sensory tasks with practice. But it is not known in general whether cortical representations become stronger (response gain increases) with practice, or whether downstream decoding becomes more effective. To examine the neural basis of learning, we are training animals to perform controlled learning tasks and examining how neural responses change with learning. We will adapt the models from project 1 to predict what circuit changes might lead to any response changes, and follow up that work with experimental tests of the predictions. This work will explain how the brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, changes during learning to support improved behavior. Understanding the circuit elements that change with learning is made possible by insights from theoretical work on networks that relates neural activity to circuit and anatomical features.

In the cerebral cortex, each excitatory cell receives thousands of synaptic inputs. A central question in neuroscience is how these inputs are summed to produce spiking outputs. For example, in primary sensory cortex, a particular sensory stimulus can evoke different numbers of spikes depending on the behavioral state of the animal, presumably reflecting one sort of summation change response gain variability. Theoretical work has characterized an array of input-summation processes that are potentially used by cortical networks, promising to explain generally how cortical networks respond to input. However, it has proven extremely difficult to obtain the experimental data needed to support and test this theoretical work, primarily because sensory stimuli generally affect neural activity within multiple brain regions, each of which could subsequently provide input to the area under study. Optogenetic stimulation, combined with sensory stimuli, can provide critical tests of these theoretical models.To understand how cortical neurons perform computation, we use a joint experimental and theoretical approach. We are measuring how mouse visual cortical neurons respond to combinations of optogenetic and visual input, and using network models to understand the circuit features that shape those input responses.

Our primary goal is to maintain the highest level of utility of the facility resources for users at all levels of expertise while continuing to develop and implement cutting edge functional MRI (fMRI) methods and applications. Our service goal requires constant scanner maintenance, user education and interaction, and commitment to setting the standard as the best fMRI center in the world in terms of research quality. Our technologists are instructed specifically to help users achieve their goals, rather than simply remind them of what they cannot do. Of course, highest adherence to all NIH, Clinical Center, and NMR Facility guidelines is followed, however, our philosophy is to be proactive, flexible, creative in finding suitable solutions to users needs. Vinai Roopchansingh has been working extremely hard to maintain an adaptive schedule that takes into consideration scanner availability, users needs, and technologists work schedules. This is a highly non-trivial task in itself. Much of the work in educating, investigating problems, setting up standard protocols, and coordinating research groups needs is also not mentioned in the summary, however, all staff have been involved with these time consuming tasks.The priorities and major policy, staff, and purchasing decisions of the FMRIF are determined by FMRIF senior staff while receiving continuous feedback through many channels with all users as well as a constant rapport with the scientific and clinical directors of NIMH. The FMRIF staff and director of the FMRIF are also regular participants in the monthly Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Facility (NMRF) steering committee meetings which set priorities and policies.Toward the mission of developing cutting edge fMRI and MRI methods, we have upgraded our two GE HDx scanners, and have established a day of scanning on the NIAAA-operated Siemens Prisma 3T scanner. We are also actively developing real time fMRI, multi-echo fMRI, and simultaneous Electroencephalography (EEG) and fMRI. This new technology will allow higher sensitivity, higher speed, and higher signal to noise imaging for anatomic and functional MRI.Lastly, the FMRIF handles data acquisition, but has now finalized the initiation of two teams. A team is a sub-core or a mini-core that has the potential to grow into a core in an of itself. These two teams: The Machine Learning Team, directed by Francisco Pereira, and the Data Sharing Team, directed by Adam Thomas, have already become separate entities, operating nearly independently of the FMRIF, aside from some guidance and direction from the FMRIF director. They are writing their own annual reports and are not mentioned further here.

The primary goals of this Core facility are to help NIH intramural investigators carry out their analyses of brain functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, in order to extract regions and networks that are involved in specific human activities, and especially to detect which regions and networks differ between normal subjects and patients in various groups and conditions. A secondary goal is to provide some general statistical consulting to NIH intramural investigators (not necessarily limited to analysis of imaging datasets).fMRI and MRI data analysis is challenging, since the amount of data involved is huge (multiple gigabytes per subject, and 20-100 subjects per study), numerous complex processing steps are required to extract the small components of the data that are relevant to brain activity and networks, and in most cases there is no generally agreed upon set of analysis methods to apply. The state-of-the-art in both image acquisition technology and analysis methodology is in continual flux, is racked by occasional controversies and panics, has no ""cut and dried"" or fully-automated solutions, and new MRI-based projects often require new or modified types of statistical analysis. The Scientific and Statistical Computing Core educates users in the techniques of fMRI analyses, and consults with users about the details of their specific research projects and how to carry out their data analyses in various software tools, including Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI), Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL), and FreeSurfer from MGH/Harvard.The Core also develops new processing methods, or adapts them from the research literature, and implements them in software (the AFNI package), so intramural researchers will have access to the reliable and flexible tools they need. Many changes to the software are motivated by intramural researchers' specific requests and needs; other upgrades are based on the Core's vision of what will be useful in the future. The Core is very aggressive at fixing bugs in the software, usually within a few days. These open-source software tools are also made available to non-NIH researchers (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov and via GitHub), and are used at dozens of institutions around the world. Software support is provided by a very active Web-based message board, by teaching a multi-day course on how to analyze fMRI data with the Core's software, and by meetings with NIH intramural researchers to help them understand their data and the analysis options.The Core does not collect human or animal data for its own projects. All data handled by the Core comes from NIH investigators, typically in conjunction with questions about data quality and/or data analysis. Such consultations can range from minutes to hours, and are often prolonged over the course of a research study.

","Scientific and Statistical Computing Core


","Scientific and Statistical Computing Core, NIMH","
The principal mission of the Core is to help NIH researchers with analyses of their fMRI (brain activation mapping) and structural MRI (brain anatomy) data. Along the way, we also help non-NIH investigators, mostly in the USA but also some abroad. Several levels of help are provided, from short-term immediate aid to long-term development and planning.Consultations:The shortest term help comprises in-person consultations with investigators about issues that arise in their research. The issues involved are quite varied, since there are many steps in carrying out fMRI and MRI data analyses and there are many different types of experiments. Common problems include:- How to set up experimental design so that data can be analyzed effectively?- Interpretation and correction of MRI imaging artifacts (for example: subject head motion during scanning).- How to set up time series analysis to extract brain activation effects of interest, and to suppress non-activation artifacts?- Why don't AFNI results agree with SPM/FSL/something else?- How to analyze data to reveal connections between brain regions during specific mental tasks, or at rest?- How to recognize poor quality data?- How to carry out reliable inter-patient (group) statistical analysis, especially when non-MRI data (e.g., genetic information, age, disease rating) needs to be incorporated?- How to get good registration between the functional results and the anatomical reference images, and between the brain images from different subjects?- What sequence of programs is ""best"" for analyzing a particular kind of data?- Reports of real or imagined bugs in the AFNI software, as well as feature requests (small, large, and extravagant).- Analysis problems related to diffusion weighted MRI data, which are acquired to reveal the anatomical connections in the brain.There are familiar themes in many of these consultations, but each meeting and each experiment raises unique questions and usually requires digging into the goals and details of the research project in order to ensure that nothing central is being overlooked. The first question asked by a user is often not the right question to answer. Complex statistical or data processing issues are often raised. Often, software needs to be developed or modified to help researchers answer their specific questions. Helping with the Methods sections of papers, or with responses to reviewers, is often part of our duties.Educational Efforts:The Core developed (and updated) a 40-hour hands-on course on how to design and analyze fMRI data that was taught twice at the NIH during FY 2017 to over 250 students. All material for this continually evolving course (software, sample data, scripts, and PDF slides) are freely available on our Web site (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov). The course material includes several sample datasets that are used to illustrate the entire process, starting with images output by MRI scanners and continuing through to the collective statistical analysis of groups of subjects. By invitation, we also taught versions of this course at 4 non-NIH sites (expenses for these trips were sponsored by the hosts): U Shenzhen, South China Normal University, MIT, and U Washington.  More than 1200 AFNI forum postings were made by Core members, mostly in answer to queries from users.Algorithm and Software Development:The longest-term support consists of developing (or adapting) new methods and software for fMRI data analysis, both to solve current problems and in anticipation of new needs. All of our software is incorporated into the AFNI package, which is Unix/Linux/Macintosh-based open-source and is available for download by anyone in source code (GitHub) or binary formats (Core server). New programs are created, and old programs modified, in response to specific user requests and in response to the Core's vision of what will be needed in the future. The Core also assists NIH labs in setting up computer systems for use with AFNI, and maintains an active Web site with a forum for questions (and answers) about fMRI data analysis.Notable developments during FY 2017 include:- A great deal of infrastructure software maintenance and development was undertaken; for example, the widespread Python programming language underwent major revisions, which required the Core to modify a number of scripts written in Python; AFNI is beginning to support the new BIDS structure for storing all the data from an multi-subject experiment; various tools for visualizing MRI data quality were developed; a simpler AFNI installation script for Mac OS X was created; the online documentation for AFNI software was greatly expanded.- A new set of diffusion MRI processing tools was implemented, including: automatic quality control, a full demo with data and processing scripts, a series of webpages containing step-by-step instructions, and a script for data quality control that is fast enough to run while the subject is still in the scanner.- A push to incorporate multi-echo fMRI processing into our principal analysis script was started. At this report, the ME-fMRI script does work, but it needs improvement and will benefit from coordination with related extramural efforts.- Tools were developed for: measuring cortical thickness; making brain templates from a collection of subject 3D images (this was applied to create a new Pan-Indian brain template, helping researchers in Bangalore to create a toddler brain template, and to create a marmoset brain template)); for checking brain image data to see if it is left-right flipped (which happens!).- A method for carrying out simultaneous 3D brain image alignment and removal of non-brain tissue was developed and implemented, and is our recommended technique for these processing steps.- A novel method, using Bayesian ideas, was created and implemented for carrying out group analyses in fMRI datasets. This method pools noise estimates across brain regions, reducing uncertainty in the final output brain maps.- Core personnel helped create the Rene Fleming brain map video using the Core's surface mapping software (SUMA): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d-PlEAQMBY Public Health Impact:From Oct 2017 to Aug 2018, the principal AFNI publication has been cited in 427 papers (cf Scopus). Most of our work supports basic research into brain function, but some of our work is more closely tied to or applicable to specific diseases:- We collaborate with Dr. Alex Martin (NIMH) to apply our resting state analysis methods to autism spectrum disorder.- We consult frequently with NIMH researchers (e.g., Drs. Pine, Ernst, Grillon, Leibenluft) working in mood and anxiety disorders.- We consult with Dr. Elliot Stein (NIDA) in his research applying fMRI methods to drug abuse and addiction, and to Dr. Reza Momenan (NIAAA) in his studies of alcoholism.- We collaborate with Dr Ernesta Meintjes (U Cape Town) on data analysis of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the brains of infants and toddlers.- Our precise registration tools (for aligning fMRI scans to anatomical reference scans) are important for individual subject applications of brain mapping, such as pre-surgical fMRI planning.- Our real-time fMRI software is being used for studies on brain mapping feedback in neurological disorders, is used daily for quality control at the NIH fMRI scanners, and is also used at a few extramural sites.- Our statistical methods are being applied to epilepsy patients undergoing surgical planning with electro-corticography.

The primary goals of this Core facility are to help NIH intramural investigators carry out their analyses of brain functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, in order to extract regions and networks that are involved in specific human activities, and especially to detect which regions and networks differ between normal subjects and patients in various groups and conditions. A secondary goal is to provide some general statistical consulting to NIH intramural investigators (not necessarily limited to analysis of imaging datasets).fMRI and MRI data analysis is challenging, since the amount of data involved is huge (multiple gigabytes per subject, and 20-100 subjects per study), numerous complex processing steps are required to extract the small components of the data that are relevant to brain activity and networks, and in most cases there is no generally agreed upon set of analysis methods to apply. The state-of-the-art in both image acquisition technology and analysis methodology is in continual flux, is racked by occasional controversies and panics, has no ""cut and dried"" or fully-automated solutions, and new MRI-based projects often require new or modified types of statistical analysis. The Scientific and Statistical Computing Core educates users in the techniques of fMRI analyses, and consults with users about the details of their specific research projects and how to carry out their data analyses in various software tools, including Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI), Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL), and FreeSurfer from MGH/Harvard.The Core also develops new processing methods, or adapts them from the research literature, and implements them in software (the AFNI package), so intramural researchers will have access to the reliable and flexible tools they need. Many changes to the software are motivated by intramural researchers' specific requests and needs; other upgrades are based on the Core's vision of what will be useful in the future. The Core is very aggressive at fixing bugs in the software, usually within a few days. These open-source software tools are also made available to non-NIH researchers (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov and via GitHub), and are used at dozens of institutions around the world. Software support is provided by a very active Web-based message board, by teaching a multi-day course on how to analyze fMRI data with the Core's software, and by meetings with NIH intramural researchers to help them understand their data and the analysis options.The Core does not collect human or animal data for its own projects. All data handled by the Core comes from NIH investigators, typically in conjunction with questions about data quality and/or data analysis. Such consultations can range from minutes to hours, and are often prolonged over the course of a research study.

The principal mission of the Core is to help NIH researchers with analyses of their fMRI (brain activation mapping) and structural MRI (brain anatomy) data. Along the way, we also help non-NIH investigators, mostly in the USA but also some abroad.

The primary goal of the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Core Facility is to enable intramural NIH investigators to complete all aspects of an MEG study, in order to better understand brain function in healthy and disease states. This includes consultation on experimental design, training in data acquisition, support of data analysis and training in data analytic methods, and consultation on the interpretation of complex findings. A secondary goal of the Core Facility is education and training. This is accomplished through courses, workshops, and one-on-one training and assistance. A tertiary goal of the MEG core facility is to undertake projects of benefit to the greater MEG community, which includes hosting workshops, coordinating reliability studies, development and testing of methods designed to increase data quality, and development and testing of new analytic methods.Because the MEG community is relatively small compared to the fMRI community, many investigators come to the core facility with only basic knowledge of MEG. In addition, due to the complexity of neurophysiological signals, data processing requires a substantial amount of knowledge and training. Many of our investigators are cognitive neuroscientists; analysis of data acquired using complex cognitive paradigms is complicated and frequently involves an idiosyncratic approach. Thus, MEG Core Facility expertise in MEG data analysis is vital to the primary mission of the core.

","NIMH MEG Core Facility


","Magnetoencephalography Core, NIMH","
Hardware:The MEG Core operates a state-of-the-art 275 channel MEG system (CTF MEG). A complete assortment of stimulus delivery and subject response equipment is interfaced to the MEG system. In November of 2017, the electronics controlling the MEG system was completely replaced by new equipment, reducing noise in the MEG signals, increasing reliability, and decreasing power and cooling requirements.  Backup stimulus delivery hardware was acquired to ensure uninterrupted operation of the facility. We upgraded existing equipment to allow NIH IRP laboratories to use more complex response devices (such as joysticks). We have also acquired and installed a state of the art Propixx projection system, which will enable vision research with exquisite precision of stimulus delivery.Additionally, in FY18 a contract was awarded to install a 100% helium recovery and recycling unit.  This will eliminate the reliance of the lab on the procurement of liquid helium, a scarce non-renewable natural resource. After an initial break-even point of several years, this system is estimated to save the US federal government approximately $100,000 per year. Software:A variety of software for data analysis is maintained and supported by the Core, including proprietary CTF code, beamformer source reconstruction software (the SAM suite) written in-house, which interfaces with AFNI (SSCC, DIRP, NIMH) and Freesurfer, Fieldtrip, and MNE-Python. In addition, the MEG Core Facility frequently writes custom scripts to integrate stimulus and response data with the MEG dataset. The Core also actively develops new functionality within the SAM software suite, which is freely available online at our website (https://megcore.nih.gov). Automated MEG-MRI co-registration based on cortical surface normals was developed and will be presented at the 2018 BioMag meeting in Philadelphia, PA. A novel method for calculating connectivity based upon measurements of entropy has also been developed and will be presented at the same meeting. Additional software development includes the implementation of a patch beamformer which may offer greater signal to noise than a distributed source model approach. The MEG Core facility also assists investigators in setting up MEG software and ensures that all software is available on shared resources (The NIH High Performance Computing (HPC) center).Education and Training:As noted earlier, the field of MEG is relatively small compared to the MRI community, and there are fewer well-established methods. The analysis of complex tasks designed to test innovative hypotheses requires unique approaches. The MEG Core Facility staff can leverage its wealth of experience to support and train investigators on these tasks.  One-on-one training and support are provided upon request, and accounts for a significant portion of the scientific staffs time.  In FY 2018, the MEG Core facility held the first ever MEG Course on the NIH campus. There were 24 attendees, from 3 different NIH institutes. The course handouts are available freely on our website (https://megcore.nih.gov). This course is expected to continue on an annual basis.Support of the Larger MEG Community:As an effort to foster collaboration and communication across North American research and clinical MEG laboratories, the MEG Core Facility first hosted the MEG-North America Workshop in 2016 over two days on the NIH campus. Building upon the success of the first meeting, a second meeting was held in November 2017, also over two days. The first day of the meeting was a series of working groups, examining issues of interest to the greater community, including reproducibility and reliability, data sharing, facilitation of best practices, and academic/industry partnerships. A collaborative white paper based upon these working groups is in progress. At the end of FY 2018, a half-day MEG-North America symposium will be held as a satellite meeting to the 2018 BioMag conference in Philadelphia, PA. We plan to continue these meetings to further facilitate collaboration and synergy across laboratories. During FY 2018, an amendment was crafted to the NIMH protocol Recruitment and Characterization of Healthy Research Volunteers for NIMH Intramural studies (NCT03304665), to add an optional MEG study. The intention of this is to compile a normative database of healthy subjects, with MEG, MRI, behavioral phenotyping, and genetic information.  It is anticipated that this will serve as a valuable resource to the MEG community as a whole. As part of this project, a paradigm was designed by the MEG Core, with input from PIs involved in MEG research at the NIH, designed to assess multiple cognitive domains which are important in the pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Scientific Contribution:The primary focus of the MEG Core Facility is to facilitate and enable the science of other NIMH investigators. However, based upon scientific interests, MEG Core Facility scientists frequently collaborate with other investigator to analyze data and test novel hypotheses. In FY18, core personnel have collaborated extensively with the labs of Carlos A. Zarate, Jr. (ETPB) and Karen F. Berman (CTNB) to gain insights into the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. Details regarding these collaborations are available in the attached project bibliography and in forthcoming publications.

In addition, due to the complexity of neurophysiological signals, data processing requires a substantial amount of knowledge and training. Many of our investigators are cognitive neuroscientists; analysis of data acquired using complex cognitive paradigms is complicated and frequently involves an idiosyncratic approach. Thus, MEG Core Facility expertise in MEG data analysis is vital to the primary mission of the core. 

Hardware:The MEG Core operates a state-of-the-art 275 channel MEG system (CTF MEG). A complete assortment of stimulus delivery and subject response equipment is interfaced to the MEG system. In November of 2017, the electronics controlling the MEG system was completely replaced by new equipment, reducing noise in the MEG signals, increasing reliability, and decreasing power and cooling requirements.  Backup stimulus delivery hardware was acquired to ensure uninterrupted operation of the facility. We upgraded existing equipment to allow NIH IRP laboratories to use more complex response devices (such as joysticks). We have also acquired and installed a state of the art Propixx projection system, which will enable vision research with exquisite precision of stimulus delivery.Additionally, in FY18 a contract was awarded to install a 100% helium recovery and recycling unit.  This will eliminate the reliance of the lab on the procurement of liquid helium, a scarce non-renewable natural resource. After an initial break-even point of several years, this system is estimated to save the US federal government approximately $100,000 per year. Software:A variety of software for data analysis is maintained and supported by the Core, including proprietary CTF code, beamformer source reconstruction software (the SAM suite) written in-house, which interfaces with AFNI (SSCC, DIRP, NIMH) and Freesurfer, Fieldtrip, and MNE-Python. In addition, the MEG Core Facility frequently writes custom scripts to integrate stimulus and response data with the MEG dataset. The Core also actively develops new functionality within the SAM software suite, which is freely available online at our website (https://megcore.nih.gov). Automated MEG-MRI co-registration based on cortical surface normals was developed and will be presented at the 2018 BioMag meeting in Philadelphia, PA. A novel method for calculating connectivity based upon measurements of entropy has also been developed and will be presented at the same meeting. Additional software development includes the implementation of a patch beamformer which may offer greater signal to noise than a distributed source model approach. The MEG Core facility also assists investigators in setting up MEG software and ensures that all software is available on shared resources (The NIH High Performance Computing (HPC) center).Education and Training:As noted earlier, the field of MEG is relatively small compared to the MRI community, and there are fewer well-established methods. The analysis of complex tasks designed to test innovative hypotheses requires unique approaches. The MEG Core Facility staff can leverage its wealth of experience to support and train investigators on these tasks.  One-on-one training and support are provided upon request, and accounts for a significant portion of the scientific staffs time.  In FY 2018, the MEG Core facility held the first ever MEG Course on the NIH campus. There were 24 attendees, from 3 different NIH institutes. The course handouts are available freely on our website (https://megcore.nih.gov). This course is expected to continue on an annual basis.Support of the Larger MEG Community:As an effort to foster collaboration and communication across North American research and clinical MEG laboratories, the MEG Core Facility first hosted the MEG-North America Workshop in 2016 over two days on the NIH campus. Building upon the success of the first meeting, a second meeting was held in November 2017, also over two days. The first day of the meeting was a series of working groups, examining issues of interest to the greater community, including reproducibility and reliability, data sharing, facilitation of best practices, and academic/industry partnerships. A collaborative white paper based upon these working groups is in progress. At the end of FY 2018, a half-day MEG-North America symposium will be held as a satellite meeting to the 2018 BioMag conference in Philadelphia, PA. We plan to continue these meetings to further facilitate collaboration and synergy across laboratories. During FY 2018, an amendment was crafted to the NIMH protocol Recruitment and Characterization of Healthy Research Volunteers for NIMH Intramural studies (NCT03304665), to add an optional MEG study. The intention of this is to compile a normative database of healthy subjects, with MEG, MRI, behavioral phenotyping, and genetic information.  It is anticipated that this will serve as a valuable resource to the MEG community as a whole. As part of this project, a paradigm was designed by the MEG Core, with input from PIs involved in MEG research at the NIH, designed to assess multiple cognitive domains which are important in the pathophysiology of psychiatric and neurological disorders. Scientific Contribution:The primary focus of the MEG Core Facility is to facilitate and enable the science of other NIMH investigators. However, based upon scientific interests, MEG Core Facility scientists frequently collaborate with other investigator to analyze data and test novel hypotheses. In FY18, core personnel have collaborated extensively with the labs of Carlos A. Zarate, Jr. (ETPB) and Karen F. Berman (CTNB) to gain insights into the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. Details regarding these collaborations are available in the attached project bibliography and in forthcoming publications.

The goals of the Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) Core are to support NIH investigators, in both clinical and basic sciences, who use MRS as a research tool. MRS follows the same fundamental principles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), except that MRS measures molecules other than water. Because it is noninvasive (it has been called the noninvasive biopsy method), MRS can provide vital biochemical information about the living brain. It currently plays a critical role in expanding our understanding of brain neurochemistry and function. The MRS Core aims to: (1) provide technical support to existing MRS protocols to ensure the highest quality of data acquisition and analysis; (2) track and convey technical advances in the field; (3) develop and implement MRS techniques required to advance the research aims of NIH investigators.

","Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Core Facility


","Magnetic Resonance Core, NIMH","
As a noninvasive method for measuring the concentration and distribution of chemicals in the living brain, MRS is an important tool for studying brain function and disorders. However, acquiring robust measurement of MRS signals requires a sophisticated study design and the successful development, implementation and maintenance of various MRS techniques. As an active area for research, MRS technology attracts major efforts from top research centers around the world. Clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanners that are optimized for performing structural and functional imaging studies also present daunting obstacles for MRS technical development. Most MRS studies at NIH have been developed and implemented by the MRS Core under protocols 05-M-0144 (NCT00109174) and 11-M-0045 (NCT01266577). Over the last year we have continued to make progress in the following areas:1) Correction of baseline in short echo time proton MRS. Data acquisition at short echo time is needed to capture the entire metabolic profile of brain visible to proton MRS and to acquire, at the same time, the broad macromolecule baseline. The macromolecule baseline contributes to Cremer Rao Lower Bound of the metabolite signals. To quantify this effect accurately in clinical short echo time MRS, we developed and optimized a method, based on mean squared error of the baseline, for determining the smoothness of baseline. This advance has led to a more objective and reliable determination of metabolite signals (Zhang et al., Magn Reson Med, 72(4):913-22. 2014 ). 2) Automatic correction of magnetic field inhomogeneity. It is essential to optimize the homogeneity of the magnetic field for all MRS experiments, because field inhomogeneity can easily destroy the critical separation of different chemicals. More importantly, an inhomogeneous field makes it difficult to suppress the tissue water signal effectively, making the reliable detection of more dilute chemicals impossible. This is particularly the case for anatomical regions of interest to psychiatric research. We have implemented and optimized an automatic shimming method that consistently out-performs the automatic shimming methods provided by MRI scanner manufacturers. This method has greatly improved the quality of clinical MRS data acquired at NIH. 3) Multi-slice chemical shift imaging of compounds containing N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine, and choline. The MRS core maintains a chemical shift imaging technique for mapping distribution of the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate at 3 Tesla. This method simultaneously generates images of N-acetylaspartate (a prominent neuronal marker), creatine, and choline-containing compounds. 4) Glutathione detection. Glutathione is a marker for oxidative stress. Many psychiatric and neurological disorders (such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke) are associated with abnormal glutathione levels. In collaboration with Steven Warach (NINDS) a glutathione editing method was developed on the Philip 3 Tesla scanner at the Suburban Hospital for studying stroke patients using adaptive line-fitting. We have also developed a single-shot method for measuring glutathione at 7 Tesla (Lally et al, J Magn Reson Imaging. 2016, 43(1):88-98.). 5) Carbon-13 MRS. Using carbon-13 labeled glucose or the glial-specific substrate acetate, it is possible to measure brain energetics and glutamate and glutamine cycling flux. Previously we invented a method for carbon-13 MRS by combining low power stochastic decoupling and intravenous infusion of glucose with a carbon-13 label at the C2 position. This strategy makes it possible to perform viable carbon-13 MRS on single channel clinical MRI scanners. Using this strategy, we have acquired high quality carbon-13 MRS data from both the occipital and frontal lobes of healthy subjects and showed that it is feasible to detect, simultaneously, two labeling pathways in the human brain. More recently, we succeeded in implementing and optimizing this strategy on the 7 Tesla scanner with enhanced sensitivity and spectral resolution (Li et al, Magn Reson Med. 2016, 75(3):954-61), and we were the first to detect GABA turnover in the human brain. Using our 7 Tesla carbon-13 MRS method we have demonstrated, for the first time, that specific enzyme activities can be measured noninvasively in the human brain following administration of carbon-13 labeled glucose (Li et al, Sci. Rep., 8:2328:1-8 (2018)).6) Proton glutamate editing. Previously we implemented a single-voxel glutamate editing method with correction of eddy current effects for measuring glutamate concentration at 3 Tesla. A method for simultaneously extracting both glutamate and glutamine from multi-echo MRS data has also been developed and implemented (Zhang et al, Magn Reson Med. 2016, 76(3):725-32). Recently, we developed and optimized a new glutamate editing method that needs a single echo time to isolate the glutamate H4 signal at 7 Tesla. 7) GABA editing. Previously we implemented and refined a method for measuring GABA. As with N-acetylaspartate imaging, patient movements can lead to difficulty in the accurate determination of GABA. We used a navigator strategy, based on residual water, to track and correct for patient movement. We also developed special data processing software to correct for phase changes because of patient motion (van der Veen et al, NMR Biomed. 2017. doi: 10.1002/nbm.3725.). Improvements to these corrections have now been quantified and successfully applied in studies of human participants. Currently, we are quantifying glutamate concentration using GABA-edited spectral data at 3 Tesla. For measurement of GABA at 7 Tesla we have shown that combining spectral editing with shorter echo time (56 ms) and taking advantage of strong coupling effect GABA, together with glutamate, glutamine and glutathione can be measured at 7 Tesla with high precision (An et al, Magn Reson Med. 2018. doi: 10.1002/mrm.27172.).8) NAAG editing. We developed MRS methods for measuring the dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), which plays an important role in glutamate signaling. Our methods use regularized line-shape deconvolution, based on the L-curve method and Wiener filtering, to measure NAAG reliably (An et al, Magn Reson Med. 2014, 72(4):903-912). 9) 7 Tesla Phosphorus MRS imaging. We have developed a chemical shift imaging method for measuring phosphorus-containing chemicals in brain at 7 Tesla. The method has been successfully tested in occipital lobe. Development and testing for frontal lobe studies are currently in progress. We are also developing data fitting strategies to extract NAD+ and NADH from phosphorus MRS spectra.10) Highly accelerated full density simulation of multispin systems for spatially localized MRS. Prior to our work the state of the art quantum mechanical simulation of multispin systems for generating basis function for spectral fitting may require prohibitively long computation time (up to a few months). We recently invented a vastly accelerated one dimensional simulation method that that reduces computation time to minutes (Zhang et al, Med. Phys., 44:4169-4178 (2017)). As a result, highly accurate spatial digitization of MRS voxel can now be routinely used. Our method greatly improves quantification of clinical proton MRS data and have already been adopted by several major MRS groups around the world.

One of the most striking and impactful neuroscience advances in the past decades is the capacity to visualize spatially localized activity throughout the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The Neurophysiology Imaging Facility (NIF) is a research core facility that provides MRI services to a wide NIH research community studying the brain mechanisms in health and disease of nonhuman primates. The NIF facility offers services in two main categories. The first category is anatomical imaging: researchers now routinely obtain anatomical MRI scans of their subjects for example prior to any procedure.  For example, such scans allow for the efficient guidance of electrodes to target structures of interest. Second, the facility makes functional MRI (fMRI)possible for a wide range of groups, effectively lowering the barriers for nonhuman primate imaging. It is the latter of these two types of services that is most challenging and is the main focus of the NIF core. For the past 10 years, the core has focused its operation around a vertical 4.7T scanner.  To meet the users' growing needs, an additional horizontal 3T scanner is to be delivered in the coming months. In addition to its service role, the NIF core pursues a few MRI-related research projects. These include those related to the origin of the blood-based functional MRI signal, the use of tractography based on diffusion MRI, and comparative fMRI across different mammalian brains. The NIF core was founded in 2004 under a joint initiative from NIMH, NINDS, and NEI to integrate neuroscience research broadly across the NIH.

","Neurophysiology Imaging Facility Core:  Functional and Structural MRI


","Neurophysiology Imaging Core, NIMH","
As the technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves, and as scanners become more prevalent across the world, both structural and functional imaging have become a central part of brain research in nonhuman primates. This is because having a precise 3D map of structures or activity in the brain leads to the most efficient and targeted research, where activity in a given portion of the brain is to be measured, inhibited, or otherwise manipulated. The parallelism with human MRI methods also pushes the results from nonhuman primates to more directly applicable and translatable to humans. The NIF facility at the NIH strives to make both structural and functional imaging feasible and fluid for any laboratories on the NIH campus interested in applying these methods. We offer high resolution anatomical scans, diffusion imaging, as well as comprehensive functional imaging. Functional MRI in nonhuman primates is notoriously difficult, and is usually carried out by scientists with expertise in other domains.  Moreover, fMRI experiments in nonhuman primates are most valuable  and also most difficultwhen combined with other methods.  Thus one of our main goals is to lower the many conceptual and practical barriers involved in the scanning itself so that researchers can pursue combinatorial methods. Our staff assists in any of these scans, and further works to help scientists gain autonomy in conducting their own experiments, thus after a stint of research in the NIF facility many trainees know the basic principles of MRI and are able to operate the scanner.Functional MRI (fMRI) allows researchers to visualize activity patterns within the brain of an awake human or animal.   This approach to neuroscience often involves mapping the responses for one type of sensory stimulus relative to that for another. This straightforward type of mapping, which is routine in humans, is also routine in nonhuman primates as long as the experimental components and infrastructure are in place. There are many analysis steps between the acquisition of raw MR signals and the scientific interpretation of the measured neural signals. This is particularly true for functional MRI (fMRI), where activity maps are generated based upon the evaluation of time varying intensity values throughout the brain from a series of MR volumes. Most neuroscience researchers are not experts in the physics or engineering aspects of MRI and thus rely heavily on experts in these domains to develop and maintain the best scanning environment possible. Thus, MRI experiments are typically done in the context of a core imaging facility. In animal studies, the challenges of MRI are compounded, as technical issues such as the production of specialized radiofrequency (RF) coils and practical skills such as surgery and the animal's behavioral training become additional factors. Animal scanning is typically combined with other procedures such as pharmacological manipulation or simultaneous electrophysiological recording, often further complicating the imaging procedure. Overcoming these obstacles, however, can be of enormous value, since the capacity to map activity over the entire brain is especially powerful when combined with well-conceived manipulations or measurements. In the Fall of 2018, the 4.7T vertical scanner in the Neurophysiology Imaging Facility will be joined by a 3T horizontal scanner.  This combination will allow for a spectrum of different scanning possibilities for researchers at the NIH, ranging from routine anatomical scans to intricate, multimodal fMRI projects.  These two scanners, together with Dr. Afonso Silvas neighboring 7T smaller bore scanner, all sit in the annex of Building 49, to our knowledge represent the largest concentration of primate-designated scanners in the world.  These scanners serve all of the NIH, and will play an increasingly important role for biomedical and disease research in nonhuman primates. The arrival of the new 3T scanner will provide needed additional scanning time for our users, will centralize much of the anatomical scanning, and will accommodate the needs of two newly hired principal investigators. It will also provide for a longer-term transition to replace the 4.7T vertical scanner with a cutting-edge system in the future. Five staff members including Dr. Leopold, each from a different scientific background and with different skills, aim to provide the most efficient functional scanning possible for a broad range of investigators. Many users of the facility focus only on structural scanning, whereby the staff takes over most of the procedure and the scientist provides information about the target sites and basic scanning requirements.  This approach is widely used to identify electrophysiological target sites, the position of indwelling microelectrodes, and evaluate experimental precision of a brain manipulation such as an injection. One particularly valuable use of structural imaging is the direct comparison of electrical recording sites with foci of fMRI responses in the context of a cognitive task. There are a range of contrast options, including diffusion weighted scans that can identify features in the white matter, or provide the basis for tractography.  We have also recently purchased a computerized tomography (CT) machine to reside in the facility, and to serve as part of a pipeline to further improve surgical accuracy for a wide range of users.For functional scanning, much of the work is done by scientists in individual laboratories, which the NIF staff train to become largely autonomous in their experiments. The Intramural Research Program at the NIH is one of the very few sites around the world in which monkeys can routinely participate in both fMRI and electrophysiological studies. The fMRI studies go beyond mapping functional specialization in the brain. Experiments within the facility typically combine fMRI with other procedures, such as microelectrode recordings or pharmacological inactivation, or cortical ablation.. The fMRI experiments produce large data files that must be processed to evaluate the functional activity patterns across the brain. The facility provides storage of these data, guidance in the initial processing steps, and server machines for full data analysis.The NIF staff spends a relatively small fraction of its time carrying out research related to MRI itself. In the past several years, we have focused on completing studies related to diffusion tractography. Dr. Frank Ye scanned several ex-vivo brains and, in a highly collaborative effort with other groups inside and outside the NIH, we are continuing to study (1) the neuroanatomical basis of diffusion tractography, and (2) comparative fiber pathways across species (Takemura et al., 2017).  In addition, we have recently completed studies on the role of the basal forebrain in resting state spontaneous fMRI signals (Turchi J Chang C et al., 2018; Liu X et al., 2018), as well as collaborative work involved in atlases, templates, and data sharing (Liu C et al., 2018; Seidlitz et al., 2017; Seidlitz et al., 2018; Milham et al., 2018). At present, research in the facility is focused on the design and testing of implanted radiofrequency coils, with the hope that this method can become routine for users seeking to obtain higher signal-to-noise images. Other research lines in the facility involve the development of scanning with newly available contrast agents.

One of the most striking and impactful neuroscience advances in the past decades is the capacity to visualize spatially localized activity throughout the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The Neurophysiology Imaging Facility (NIF) is a research core facility that provides MRI services to a wide NIH research community studying the brain mechanisms in health and disease of nonhuman primates. The NIF facility offers services in two main categories. The first category is anatomical imaging: researchers now routinely obtain anatomical MRI scans of their subjects for example prior to any procedure.  For example, such scans allow for the efficient guidance of electrodes to target structures of interest. Second, the facility makes functional MRI (fMRI)possible for a wide range of groups, effectively lowering the barriers for nonhuman primate imaging. It is the latter of these two types of services that is most challenging and is the main focus of the NIF core. For the past 10 years, the core has focused its operation around a vertical 4.7T scanner.  To meet the users' growing needs, an additional horizontal 3T scanner is to be delivered in the coming months. In addition to its service role, the NIF core pursues a few MRI-related research projects. These include those related to the origin of the blood-based functional MRI signal, the use of tractography based on diffusion MRI, and comparative fMRI across different mammalian brains. The NIF core was founded in 2004 under a joint initiative from NIMH, NINDS, and NEI to integrate neuroscience research broadly across the NIH.

As the technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves, and as scanners become more prevalent across the world, both structural and functional imaging have become a central part of brain research in nonhuman primates. This is because having a precise 3D map of structures or activity in the brain leads to the most efficient and targeted research, where activity in a given portion of the brain is to be measured, inhibited, or otherwise manipulated. The parallelism with human MRI methods also pushes the results from nonhuman primates to more directly applicable and translatable to humans. The NIF facility at the NIH strives to make both structural and functional imaging feasible and fluid for any laboratories on the NIH campus interested in applying these methods. We offer high resolution anatomical scans, diffusion imaging, as well as comprehensive functional imaging. Functional MRI in nonhuman primates is notoriously difficult, and is usually carried out by scientists with expertise in other domains.  Moreover, fMRI experiments in nonhuman primates are most valuable  and also most difficultwhen combined with other methods.  Thus one of our main goals is to lower the many conceptual and practical barriers involved in the scanning itself so that researchers can pursue combinatorial methods. Our staff assists in any of these scans, and further works to help scientists gain autonomy in conducting their own experiments, thus after a stint of research in the NIF facility many trainees know the basic principles of MRI and are able to operate the scanner.Functional MRI (fMRI) allows researchers to visualize activity patterns within the brain of an awake human or animal.   This approach to neuroscience often involves mapping the responses for one type of sensory stimulus relative to that for another. This straightforward type of mapping, which is routine in humans, is also routine in nonhuman primates as long as the experimental components and infrastructure are in place. There are many analysis steps between the acquisition of raw MR signals and the scientific interpretation of the measured neural signals. This is particularly true for functional MRI (fMRI), where activity maps are generated based upon the evaluation of time varying intensity values throughout the brain from a series of MR volumes. Most neuroscience researchers are not experts in the physics or engineering aspects of MRI and thus rely heavily on experts in these domains to develop and maintain the best scanning environment possible. Thus, MRI experiments are typically done in the context of a core imaging facility. In animal studies, the challenges of MRI are compounded, as technical issues such as the production of specialized radiofrequency (RF) coils and practical skills such as surgery and the animal's behavioral training become additional factors. Animal scanning is typically combined with other procedures such as pharmacological manipulation or simultaneous electrophysiological recording, often further complicating the imaging procedure.

The causes of neuropsychiatric disorders have remained elusive. Attempts to overlay behavioral disease symptoms on the map of the human genome has been frustrating as, one by one, the correlations between a gene and a disease are weakened. Genetic risk factors have been identified for a handful of mental disorders, but both the penetrance and the modulation of the effect of these genes are variable. The mechanisms that lead to these diseases are also difficult to trace because they act indirectly. Even in cases where disease is seen as a regression at distinct ages (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, for instance) the links to gene expression are elusive. The causes of mental health disorders are further obscured because they affect the basic processes of development, network connections and plasticity of the nervous system. Adding to this complexity are the difficulties of studying the dysfunction in patients where the course of disease may span a lifetime and symptoms vary between individuals.Transgenic animals have been used to show the link between genes and many diseases. For mental health disorders, this is difficult because complete and complex human behaviors cannot be observed in animals. However,  there are biochemical, electrophysiological, and simple behaviors that can reveal the role of these genes in the development, adaption and function of the nervous system. The common features of all mammalian brains, including the conservation of significant genes, can be used to study neural system function. But even so, therapies that have been developed and shown promise in rodents have failed to alleviate patients burdens. The use of new technologies allows more efficient and precise genetic engineering of research animals. These techniques can be applied to cells as well as in species that were previously intractable and show promise for expanding our understanding of the link between genes and neuropsychiatric disease.

","Transgenic Resources for Neuroscience Research


","Transgenic Core, NIMH","
The NIMH transgenic core facility has several major functions: 1) to produce transgenic research animals for neuroscience research, 2) to support research with associated techniques in genetic research in neuroscience, 3) to develop new transgenic techniques and model systems and 4) to engage in collaborative projects that promote genetic approaches to neuroscience research.1) Production Metrics of production over the past year include: a) 19 transgenic mouse projects produced by oocyte injection of DNA or CRISPR constructs, with multiple lines produced for each project.b) Five projects using embryonic stem cells (ESC) have been undertaken.c) Three transgenic rat projects produced by oocyte injection, with multiple lines produced for each project.2) Technical Support a) 87 transgenic rodent lines have been archived by cryopreserving germ cells or embryos. b) 39 lines have been re-derived, by transferring lines from pathogen-bearing animals into those with defined health status. c) Transgenic project design and assistance have continued to be significant to NIH neuroscience labs that lack experience in producing transgenic animals.3) Technical development a) Nuclease-mediated genetic engineering (CRISPR): Mouse embryonic development has been observed and manipulated for decades. Genetic manipulation has taken advantage of the ability to grow totipotent cells (embryonic stem cells, ESC) in a dish. Other species, including primates, have been refractory to the same technique that works so well for mice. The result has been an ever-expanding collection of transgenic mouse lines that scientists use to test the role of virtually every one of the roughly 20,000 genes that make up a mouse genome.  Now, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to target genes more efficiently and as specifically as in mouse ESC, but is applicable to other species. The core has focused on using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate conditional knock out genes in mice, rats and primates. In these animals, recombination signals are inserted to flank critical regions of a gene. Only when a recombinase is expressed in the cell is the gene function disrupted. Subtle changes in the gene can also be made, but making a conditional modification replaces large segments of a gene.The core has over the last year benefited from a collaboration with Nick Ryba in the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to improve the efficiency of modifying genes by replacing large segments. We have optimized concentration of the injected material, the use of reagents to optimize homologous recombination of donor sequences, the site of injection in embryos, and the construction of nucleic acid targeting vectors. These techniques are now being applied to make mouse and rat transgenics, with the ultimate aim of making the technique efficient enough to use in species with smaller numbers of offspring, and longer gestation and maturation times, such as marmosets.b) Transgenic marmosets: In collaboration with Erika Sasaki at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals in Kawasaki, Japan the core has produced a line of transgenic marmosets that expresses a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) which will allow the visualization of neuronal activity in vivo. To expand a line of animals that expresses this gene, we have developed an artificial insemination procedure that has resulted in multiple pregnancies in the NIMH colony and in the Xiaoqin Wang's colony at Johns Hopkins University. These animals are being used for experiments on the activity in the sensory cortex.c) Transgenic rat lines: Over 50 laboratories from around the world have requested transgenic rat lines that were produced by the transgenic core in collaboration with labs in the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). These lines are being maintained and distributed by  the RRRC (Rat Resource and Research Center). More than ten of these lines that express CRE recombinase in specific neuronal subtypes are continuing to be characterized for their patterns of expression. An inbred line of rats that expresses the orange fluorescent protein (OFP) was used by Alan Korestsky's group (NINDS) to study the potential of transplanted neural stem cells (Pothayee et al. Communications BIology 14 August 2018 doi. 10.1038/s42003-018-0113-8)d) Support techniques: several techniques are under development to increase the capacity of the core's support functions. Freezing mouse sperm and improving IVF by using newer methods is a major effort. Freezing rat sperm and achieving IVF in rats at an acceptable level is a challenging task in all laboratories. A method of introducing adeno-associated virus (AAV) to the brain through the peripheral circulation is also underway. This method would allow more widespread delivery of a transgene and eliminate the need for intracranial delivery by surgical intervention.

The mission of Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) within the National Institute of Mental Health, Division of Intramural Programs (NIMH IRP) is to conduct and support research on brain and behavior, with the goal of reducing the burden of mental illness. HBCC is a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research. To conduct this research, we obtain human brain tissue, hair and blood samples from deceased individuals diagnosed with major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and their consequences (suicide) as well as from individuals without history of mental illness (used as controls). The tissues are obtained under protocol 17-M-N073 (NCT03092678) approved by the Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board (CNS IRB) and only with the permission of next-of-kin. HBCC distributes samples to investigators approved by an NIMH Oversight Committee. We collect molecular and genetic data and disseminate the data to the scientific community. Information gained from this research will lead to better understanding of brain dysfunction in mental disorders and development of new therapeutic and preventive strategies.HBCC functions to:-Distribute well characterized brain specimens to approved investigators -Prepare high quality tissue, RNA and DNA and other derivative samples for distribution to approved investigators-Provide scientific advice on neuroanatomical, molecular, clinical and technical aspects of projects involving human brain tissue-Perform molecular and genetic studies-Assist medical examiners offices (MEOs) by providing neuropathology reports-Disseminate data to the scientific community within and outside NIH using custom and publicly available databases (dbGaP, Synapse)We obtain brains through the Chief Medical Examiners Offices (CMEOs) of Northern and Central Virginia and the District of Columbia. We protect the confidentiality of the decedent by removing his/her name and all identifying information from any materials we receive, and label all samples and the information derived from them only with a number. Our personnel audiotape the next-of-kin's consent as an official record of the donation. We obtain further information about the decedent's medical and psychiatric history through interviews with the family and released medical records after obtaining written authorization from the next-of-kin. As a non-renewable resource, the human brain collection requires oversight and evaluation to ensure that specimens are distributed equitably and fairly to investigators. Requests for access to samples from the collection should be emailed to hbccmailmail.nih.gov. Requests are reviewed for consistency with NIMH and HBCC mission and goals by an oversight committee.

The mission of Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) within the National Institute of Mental Health, Division of Intramural Programs (NIMH IRP) is to conduct and support research on brain and behavior, with the goal of reducing the burden of mental illness. HBCC is a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research. To conduct this research, we obtain human brain tissue, hair and blood samples from deceased individuals diagnosed with major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and their consequences (suicide) as well as from individuals without history of mental illness (used as controls). The tissues are obtained under protocol 17-M-N073 (NCT03092678) approved by the Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board (CNS IRB) and only with the permission of next-of-kin. HBCC distributes samples to investigators approved by an NIMH Oversight Committee. We collect molecular and genetic data and disseminate the data to the scientific community. Information gained from this research will lead to better understanding of brain dysfunction in mental disorders and development of new therapeutic and preventive strategies.HBCC functions to:-Distribute well characterized brain specimens to approved investigators -Prepare high quality tissue, RNA and DNA and other derivative samples for distribution to approved investigators-Provide scientific advice on neuroanatomical, molecular, clinical and technical aspects of projects involving human brain tissue-Perform molecular and genetic studies-Assist medical examiners offices (MEOs) by providing neuropathology reports-Disseminate data to the scientific community within and outside NIH using custom and publicly available databases (dbGaP, Synapse)We obtain brains through the Chief Medical Examiners Offices (CMEOs) of Northern and Central Virginia and the District of Columbia. We protect the confidentiality of the decedent by removing his/her name and all identifying information from any materials we receive, and label all samples and the information derived from them only with a number. Our personnel audiotape the next-of-kin's consent as an official record of the donation. We obtain further information about the decedent's medical and psychiatric history through interviews with the family and released medical records after obtaining written authorization from the next-of-kin. As a non-renewable resource, the human brain collection requires oversight and evaluation to ensure that specimens are distributed equitably and fairly to investigators. Requests for access to samples from the collection should be emailed to hbccmailmail.nih.gov. Requests are reviewed for consistency with NIMH and HBCC mission and goals by an oversight committee. 

Currently, the HBCC resources include brains from individuals with the following diagnoses (numbers of subjects listed in parentheses): Bipolar disorder (153), Non-psychiatric controls (307), Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder (202), Substance Abuse (59), Major depressive disorder (237), Other psychiatric/neurological diagnoses 136, Not diagnosed (79).

The mission of the NIMH, NINDS, and NICHD Instrumentation CORE facility is to provide comprehensive engineering support in a collaborative and synergistic environment for research as requested by NIMH, NINDS and NICHD scientists.  The projects requested from our investigators include the full spectrum of applications from the cellular level, such as custom microscope chambers and perfusion systems, to insect studies with fruit flies or locusts. In addition, we do various projects for research applications using rodents, primates and, of course, human, clinical-based research. To support this mission, our Section provides a staff of engineers and technicians to fabricate custom electronic, mechanical, and electromechanical devices and instruments. The unique arrangement of our group allows us to not only help the investigators that come to us directly, but to spend many hours each week helping in the individual labs to solve electrical noise and recording problems, consult on electrophysiological recording set-ups, and to make recommendations for custom or commercial equipment or software.To provide the support necessary for each of these areas requires a dedicated staff that, over time, becomes experienced in the specific research areas such as electrophysiology, radiochemistry, behavioral testing, fMRI, etc. As part of our goal, we therefore strive to have staff expertise in each of these various research areas. This expertise allows us to better understand the investigator's requests and to recommend the right technical solution as appropriate.  Due to the multitude of requests we encounter and the limited time to devote to each request, our engineering approach is one of integration before development.  If a commercially available system or sensor can be used, we will integrate or modify it into our design first.An additional goal for our Section is to keep abreast of new technologies as they become available and to integrate these new technologies into the research as needed. Application of new technologies in the area of Rapid Prototyping and 3D printing has saved many hours of design and construction time and provided a rapid turnaround for engineering and fabrication requests.

This past year, our Section had the unique opportunity to support the research of various Labs & Sections within NIMH, NINDS, NICHD, and NCCIH. During the past twelve months, investigators from these labs and branches requested 467 formal projects from our staff. Each of these requests was documented and the time recorded to complete the job. In addition to the formal requests we are available daily for numerous walk-in, phone call or e-mail requests for assistance. In general, our technical support this past year can be divided into the following research areas:ElectrophysiologyThe Section on Instrumentation (SI) staff continuously strives to improve the utility of various components that comprise electrophysiology. We have continued to improve the engineering and fabrication of multiple-hole grid arrays that allow precise, repeatable placement of a single or multiple electrodes over a wide area. We have also continued to develop small single-electrode microdrives. Novel methods using 3D printing now allow for the production low-component count yet accurate and smooth microdrives.In FY2018, SI supported a project that will allow the placement of 120 electrodes in each of four anatomically interconnected deep brain areas.  This requires developing tiny electrode manipulators that will be permanently mounted on a custom platform fixed to the skull. It requires developing methods to use MRI-guided positioning at the four deep targets by custom fitting the platform to an individual using a combination of MRI, CAT scan, and 3D mechanical models.  It requires a superstructure to support 480 connections in 15 high-density connectors.  The platform, microdrives and superstructure must be MRI compatible.  The final design will use a mixture of 3D printing of plastics, including biocompatible plastic, a mix of brass and stainless-steel hardware and 3D printing of a titanium superstructure.  fMRISI provides a wide range of support for fMRI-related research. Fabrication of devices for use in MRI environments is a specialized area of expertise, with great attention given to design without ferrous metals and minimization of all metal components. In addition, commercial industrial fiber optic components and systems are evaluated and integrated into many designs and devices we fabricate. The Section on Instrumentation supports the installation of new equipment in MRI suites, including custom mirror and projection assemblies used for stimulus presentation, and custom RF-shielded penetration panels used to route cabling.Non-Human Primate (NHP)SI is responsible for providing a wide range of engineering and fabrication services to support non-human primate research. Many of the mechanical assemblies that are necessary for this type of research are engineered and fabricated in-house. Our group provides a diverse array of custom systems and components to many different investigators, such as custom primate chairs, high-strength restraints, MRI positioning systems, custom head coils, reward systems, data acquisition, analysis and optical response systems, plus a wide range of small mechanical components. To facilitate the social housing and welfare of animals, caging systems have been modified by SI to permit larger social groups and further enrich the environment. In addition, unique nesting and transfer boxes have been designed and constructed to attach to the caging systems to facilitate animal transfers and normal nesting behavior.  HumanHuman research requires the creation of many novel devices that are compatible with the high-magnetic field environment. When a new magnet is installed, we are consulted with and provide the necessary components for presenting visual stimuli in the bore of the magnet, including image periscopes, screens, and mirrors. These devices are designed and manufactured with specific space and material constraints. BehavioralSeveral different types of mazes are used to study spatial learning and memory in rodents. These studies have been used to help understand general principles about learning that can be applied to humans, and to determine how different treatments affect learning and memory. We continue to produce a variety of custom T and Y mazes for behavioral testing. One particular task is known as the delayed non-match-to-sample task.  Each trial in this task consists of three periods  the sample, delay and choice periods. Trials begin by the mouse sampling a maze arm. Mice must then maintain a memory of the sampled maze arm across a delay period, and use this memory in the choice period to correctly choose the opposite maze arm to receive a reward. The sample arm location is randomized every trial so that correct performance is only guided by information encoded in the most recent sample period, hence why this task is a measure of working memory. T-mazes are used to assess the neural circuits that support normal working memory function, and how these circuits fail in mouse models of predisposition to psychiatric disease.ImagingTwo-photon excitation microscopy is a fluorescence imaging technique that allows imaging of living tissue up to about one millimeter in depth. Two-photon excitation can be a superior alternative to confocal microscopy due to its deeper tissue penetration, efficient light detection, and reduced phototoxicity. SI produces a variety of equipment that supports two-photon microscopy, such as faraday cages for electronic and light shielding and custom mirror mounts, behavioral testing equipment such as low-inertia running wheels, and custom titanium headposts.SI fabricated a laser path enclosing box and microscope path light blocking box that allowed the combining of two-photon imaging of GCaMP6f and local field potential recordings in behaving mice.  In order to decipher circuit mechanisms for corticocortical communication, we produced a custom multi-amplitude and variable frequency whisker stimulator.  ClinicalOur Section also supports a number of clinical based research requests under the broad areas of surgical, therapeutic and basic research. SI continued its development on the Gustometer system for obesity studies.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the areas of the brain using fMRI that respond to gustatory stimuli. We developed an MRI compatible system that delivers specified small volumes of a variety of tastants into a patients mouth while being scanned in the MRI.  The tastants are released in a pre-programmed fashion under computer control, and the delivery of the tastants is synchronized with the scan pulse from the MRI unit. The entire fluid delivery system is pneumatically controlled powered by house medical air that has been precisely regulated to either operate the control valves or pressurize the syringes containing the tastants. The control valves are operated automatically by a computer running LabVIEW (National Instruments) software  with the requisite input/output electronics. TechnologyTechnologyBy using the latest technology in advanced fabrication machinery, we are able to increase productivity and effectiveness while at the same time decreasing the amount of time needed to engineer and machine the components. Our waterjet cutter continues to increase our cutting and fabricating capabilities, especially with the multiple fiberglass parts we produce. With this system, we were able to fabricate miniature titanium headposts that would have been very difficult to machine with conventional tooling.

The Rodent Behavioral Core (RBC) is a state-of-the-art research facility that was initiated in Nov 2015 to address the growing need across NIH to have an intramural resource for high throughput, efficient and targeted behavioral testing of rodents. The RBC offers NIH researchers validated and reliable testing of mice and rats over a broad range of physiological and behavioral domains including general health, cognitive, emotional, sensory, and motor function. The goal of the RBC is to provide all necessary support for a PI and its group to design and implement a behavioral study in rodents. This includes advice and discussion on experimental design, training and instruction in animal behavior, data collection and analyses, and the design of software and hardware. In addition to providing specialized equipment, the RBC provides two fully equipped surgical suites, as well as tracking and programming tools for trial-by-trial analysis of behavior. The RBC became fully operational in February 2017.

","Rodent Behavioral Core: The Analysis of Behavior


","Rodent Behavioral Core, NIMH","
Behavioral neuroscience links systems-level circuitry to behavior, cognition and emotion and is thus critical for understanding the afflictions that affect neuropsychiatric patients. Linking cognitive changes in a behaving rat or mouse to targeted manipulations of neural circuitry requires the convergence of expertise from scientific fields inside and outside of neuroscience. In designing research projects to understand the anatomy, genetics, and pharmacology underlying the control of behavior, researchers must understand the nature of the task, its measurements, and how to interpret the data. Several steps lie between the design of the experiment and the behavioral output, including choice of task (e.g., operant vs mazes), how to train the animal (shaping vs conditioning), the type of surgical manipulation (ablation, cannulation, inactivation, stimulation, etc.), and the format of data for analysis (summary vs. trial-by-trial). Most neuroscience researchers who use standard off-the-shelf behavioral tasks (such as forced swim, rotarod and T-Maze) are not experts in the psychology of behavior and must therefore rely on experts in the domain of cognition. Complex cognitive behavior in rodents is often gauged by measuring the pattern of behavioral responses in tasks that involve, for example, decision-making, attention, memory, rule learning, flexibility, discrimination, and problem solving. In these tasks, rats and mice typically indicate their decisions by nose-poking visual patterns on a touchscreen like an iPad, making nose-poke entries into a series of lit holes, or depressing an extended lever triggered by time or cues. Some cognitive functions extrapolated from animal behavior have positively informed our investigation of cognitive functions in humans. Such animal-to-human approaches (e.g., delayed response) have directed the design and development of analogous tests for use in humans (e.g., self-ordered working memory). Behavioral neuroscience has also benefitted in the opposite direction by means of human-to-animal approaches as in the case of extradimensionsal/intradimensional set shifting, a test based upon the principles of the human Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Together, these advances in behavioral testing have been particularly useful in establishing the neuroanatomical and neurochemical pathology for specific cognitive deficits in a range of brain and behavior disorders. In addition to providing equipment, training and consulting for researchers interested in using rodents as models to investigate disorders of brain and behavior, one important goal for the RBC is to continue to design and develop cutting edge behavioral methods and applications while maintaining facility resources at a high level of utility for users at all levels of expertise. This requires constant maintenance and calibration of equipment, user education and interaction, and commitment to setting the standard as the best Rodent Behavioral Core facility in the world in terms of research quality.Since the RBCs inception, the labs of several principal Investigators from NIMH, as well as  NINDS, NIA, NIDCD, NHGRI and NICHD have used the RBC to conduct specific behavioral studies in an efficient and targeted manner. In the past year, the labs of 30 principal investigators have used the RBC facility with over 70 trainees that have been trained in using specific resources in the Core. In some cases, we have custom designed and developed new tasks such as olfactory cue discrimination combined with navigation, and have instituted ultrasonic vocalization recordings from groups of rodent families to measure social communication. We have written custom code for individual users to provide a detailed level of behavioral analysis for their experiments. We have also enabled the installation of optogenetic equipment in operant chambers, and mazes and open testing arenas combined with tracking software, as requested by many principal investigators. In addition, due to the high demand for modern tools for motor analyses like foot-foot spacing, paw pressure, distance travelled, body rotation, stride length, and toe spread, we invested in a Gait Scan motor analysis system to provide highly sensitive and noninvasive detection and assessment of skilled motor performance that can be used to evaluate several neurological and neuromuscular disorders.Finally, because many researchers expressed an interest in combining electrophysiological methods with awake behavior, we installed a SmartBox electrophysiology system to acquire local field potentials, as well as single and multiple unit recordings. Importantly, this system integrates seamlessly with nearly every behavioral system or software in the RBC.Due to the large number of users, and the needs for custom programming for specialized equipment and experimental requirements, the demands on the staff have been great. Earlier this year, we hired a second technician to support the operations and maintenance of the core.

","Functional MRI Core, NIMH","
This is the second annual report for the Data Science and Sharing Team (DSST), our first year with our full staff in place. 2018 also marked the arrival of Francisco Pereira, the director of our sister group, the Machine Learning Team. Follows is a list of our noteworthy projects.Intramural Data SharingOver the course of 2018, our team has worked with the authors of several different projects to make their data publicly available. They include:Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2012, https://doi.org/10.15154/1464517Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.15154/1464520Shaw et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.15154/1463004Thurm et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.15154/1464602Power et al., 2018, https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000258/These datasets will be or are available through both the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) as well as our internal repository at http://nido.nimh.nih.gov which is derived from Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience's (CRN) OpenNeuro project. In 2018 we were granted supplementary funding to expand NIDO's capabilities to execute analyses directly on the NIH HPC. We are currently working closely with the CRN to implement this functionality for both NIDO and OpenNeuro.Acquisition and Maintenance of Shared Dataset on the NIH HPCOur team also makes it easy for intramural researchers to access and use data from other institutions by streamlining the authorization process. We download and organize each dataset on shared disk accessible from the NIH High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster for easy and efficient analysis. Datasets that we have download and are currently maintaining include the Human Connectome Project, the OpenNeuro Archive, and the UK Biobank Imaging Extension.Exploring Cross Scanner HarmonizationWe were approached by several member of the NIMH extramural staff to consult with them on how effective current inter-scanner homogenization techniques are. In order to test these techniques, we used the initial dataset recently released by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) project (https://abcdstudy.org/). This work is now a manuscript which is available as a preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/309260) and is currently under peer review.Aggregating Worldwide MRI Scanner Quality MetricsMRIQC is a package for assessing the quality of structural and functional MRI data. We are supporting a centralized database for aggregating anonymized quality control statistics on over 100,000 scans collected around the world. This database allows investigators to compare the data they have collected with a vast trove of similar data, to assess the quality of their scans and help guide changes in collection protocols and decide which scans need to be manually reviewed.Research Volunteers ProtocolOur team continues to collaborate with Joyce Chung and NIMH Clinical Director's Office on the Research Volunteers Protocol that was approved in October of 2017. Over 45 participants have been scanned to date using a standardized MRI protocol. The data from these participants will soon be publicly available on the NIMH Data Archive. These participants are also being actively referred to other NIMH protocols for which they qualify. For more details, see the annual report for the Clinical Director's Office.Machine Learning from Distributed DatasetsHelping to make data widely available is part of our core mission, but sometimes privacy issues make it impossible for data to be shared. We are collaborating with the Machine Learning Team on a project to build a ""parallel weight consolidation"" tool. This technique will allow researchers to train a neural network and share anonymized data from that training with a central hub that aggregates across many sites to improve its performance and prediction. See the Machine Learning Team's annual report and this preprint (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10863, currently under review) for more details on this project.Exemplifying Open ScienceOur team has served as an example of open science practices. All of our papers have been released to the public as preprints on bioRxiv prior to submission, along with code and data. We have pre-registered two large data analysis efforts with the Open Science Foundation (http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3YTQJ, http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/GCD7Z). The vast majority of the code for our own projects is available in open source repositories on github.com, where we have committed over 400 code changes. We have additionally contributed over 75 code changes to 18 open source projects across the community via github pull requests.Crowdsourcing Imaging ScienceAccurate volumetric measurements of the brain, derived from MR image segmentation, are fundamental for understanding structure-function relationships in the healthy brain, and in psychiatric and neurological disorders; however, obtaining these measurements in large datasets remains a challenge, especially in many patient populations. We sought to integrate the expertise of neuroanatomists, citizen science through crowd-sourcing, and recent advances in deep-learning algorithms for image-processing. We worked with Drs. Anisha Keshavan, Ariel Rokem, and Jason Yeatman from the University of Washington to create Medulina, an open source, web-browser based platform for biomedical image segmentation.Medulina is available online at medulina.com, and we have IRB approval from the Univ. of Washington to begin collecting citizen contributed medical image annotations. One of the available projects is to segment high resolution hippocampal images that will aid in the analysis of data recently collected and published in collaboration with the Child Psychiatry Branch (Zhou et al., 2018).Measuring and Incentivizing Open ScienceWe are working with the non-profit group ImpactStory to create an online tool for tracking how many publications from the NIMH IRP are publicly available, have open code, and have open data. ImpactStory is uniquely suited to work on this project because they have created and maintain a database of which publications are and are not publicly accessible and they have created websites with similar functionality (impactstory.org). This tool will provide the foundation for other institutions to measure and incentivize open science. Accessible, reproducible pipelines in AFNI for standardized dataThe Data Science and Sharing Team works closely with the Scientific and Statistical Computing Core. The SSCC is responsible for AFNI -- the NIMH IRP's flagship neuroimaging analysis software which is used in research on many conditions, including autism, anxiety disorders, drug addiction, major depression, and epilepsy. We collaborated with the AFNI team on a BRAIN Initiative grant for funding to make it practicable to use AFNI on large data collections stored in the cloud, or on local supercomputing clusters, accelerating research into diverse brain-based conditions in sizable groups. 	 Our grant brings AFNI's widely acknowledged analytical and visualization capabilities to cloud-based environments in order to better support BRAIN Initiative projects. Upon completing the proposed work, a user will be able to complete an entire analysis workflow including preprocessing, analysis, quality control, and visualization of results in the cloud.

Goals of the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service include conducting neurodevelopmental psychological assessments for use in clinical research and conducting research to better characterize neurodevelopmental conditions through data collected. These goals are accomplished through collaborations with investigators in both NIH intramural and extramural programs.  We provide in depth behavioral phenotyping on specific genetic conditions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, allowing for genotype-phenotype analyses to be conducted. This research includes neurodevelopmental characterization of individuals across the spectrum of cognitive and neurodevelopmental functioning. Another goal is to utilize samples with rare conditions that include severe and profound intellectual disability to validate existing measures and test newly standardized measures amenable to tracking developmental progress. An objective of this goal is to pinpoint the functional-biomarker relationships that may one day inform treatment trials. In order to meet these goals, the service collaborates with investigators both within and outside NIH to engage in multi-site studies as well as both natural history and treatment studies conducted at the NIH. In order to contribute to the mission of the NIMH to reduce the burden of mental illness, our assessments are part of comprehensive phenotyping conducted in NIH studies, which allow for diagnoses to be made and refined.

","Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping


","Office of the Clinical Director, NIMH","
The Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service conducts over 200 neurodevelopmental assessments yearly, collecting and analyzying  data from a variety of rare genetic disorders associated with Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Much of the data analyzed has been collected through a protocol that includes behavioral assessments (NCT00271622) and a collaborative protocol that includes assessment of specific rare genetic conditions (NCT02461420).  In addition, we participate in several other multi-site studies that are conducting behavioral phenotyping of conditions that have yet to have their natural histories fully explored, including Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, Moebius Syndrome, propionic acidemia, creatine transport deficiency, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome, congenital disorders of glycosylation and other diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions that affect neurodevelopment early in life. These characterization studies are necessary for understanding the breadth and depth of syndromes that cause lifelong impairments, based on developmental delays that often lead to Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Related to these goals, we seek to take advantage of gains made in identification of genetic abnormalities in those already diagnosed with ASD or Intellectual Disability, by exploring whether genotypic differences may be reflected in behavioral phenotype differences in cohorts of children diagnosed with these conditions. As such, we continue to explore data on ASD and at-risk populations collected through the NIMH intramural research program, including data from neuroimaging and sleep studies, and we have engaged in collaborative efforts to analyze genotype-phenotype data from large scale ASD collections and populations of children with ASD identified with specific genetic abnormalities. These analyses allow us to refine our understanding of when and how symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders present if genetic etiologies are identified.We are specifically focused on the rates and types of Intellectual Disability and ASD profiles within rare genetic conditions, given the implications of these diagnoses on lifelong disability and the need for potential treatment targets and appropriate outcome measures. Our collection of data using standardized autism diagnostic instruments (e.g. the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and traditional measures of intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior allows us to conduct analyses on how use of these measures function over time, and on how measurements differs within specific genetic disorders, to gain an understanding of how ASD and neurocognitive profiles may present differently based on specific etiology. Given that the field is moving towards such genetics-first approaches, we also use data from our unique study populations to explore the limitations of our current measures and terminology for fully characterizing individuals who are minimally verbal or severely intellectually impaired. This group of children are particularly important for inclusion in potential treatment trials of rare genetic conditions, but for which few tools have been developed with adequate representation in standardization samples. We also plan to use such data to improve upon existing measures, and collaborate with others to develop new tools. Our goal here is to participate in the creation of tools that capture the full range of social-communication development, including the ability to capture profiles of those with early onset of neurologic conditions. We seek to create measures that capture growth and differences that may be important for recognizing change based on treatment as well as loss of skills that often accompanies both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.

Goals of the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service include conducting neurodevelopmental psychological assessments for use in clinical research and conducting research to better characterize neurodevelopmental conditions through data collected. These goals are accomplished through collaborations with investigators in both NIH intramural and extramural programs.  We provide in depth behavioral phenotyping on specific genetic conditions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, allowing for genotype-phenotype analyses to be conducted. This research includes neurodevelopmental characterization of individuals across the spectrum of cognitive and neurodevelopmental functioning. Another goal is to utilize samples with rare conditions that include severe and profound intellectual disability to validate existing measures and test newly standardized measures amenable to tracking developmental progress. An objective of this goal is to pinpoint the functional-biomarker relationships that may one day inform treatment trials. In order to meet these goals, the service collaborates with investigators both within and outside NIH to engage in multi-site studies as well as both natural history and treatment studies conducted at the NIH. In order to contribute to the mission of the NIMH to reduce the burden of mental illness, our assessments are part of comprehensive phenotyping conducted in NIH studies, which allow for diagnoses to be made and refined.

","Sleep and Neurodevelopment Service


","Office of the Clinical Director, NIMH","
This past year the Sleep and Neurodevelopmental Service scheduled over 150  overnight sleep studies ordered by eleven different institutes, more than half for pediatric patients. We have collected sleep data on several distinct cohorts including children with childhood onset schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, McCune Albright Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Sickle Cell Disease as well as for people with various disorders of neurodevelopment with both known and unknown genetic causes. We are working with our collaborators to try to identify unique sleep signals that help define the disorders under study and therefore outline paths for potential therapeutic intervention. Some of our earliest work, looking at sleep in children with autism, helped us understand that there is a lot of information in the way the brain sleeps and that sleep neurophysiology also contains important information about the way the brain matures. We recently published our findings showing that in a large cohort of children with autism, sleep markers, called spindles, were reduced compared to children with typical development and also reduced when compared to children with developmental delays who did not also have autism. This work suggests that some markers only found in sleep, might be related to behavioral differences in children. We have recently completed a study of sleep neurophysiology in young children at risk for autism due to severe language delays through a natural history study of children ages 12 - 18 months (Protocol 11-M-0144, NCT01339767), where we were able to explore longitudinally how very early differences in sleep rhythms and maintenance may relate to aberrant development and the onset of autistic symptoms. That analysis and publication is forthcoming. These findings highlight the importance of looking at the sleeping brain during development for some of the earliest clues regarding neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, considerable gaps in knowledge still exist in our understanding of sleep measurements and how these change during the early periods of brain development. Filling in these gaps may aid in the earliest identification of mental health disorders. We work closely with the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service to best associate changes in the sleeping brain to neurodevelopmental stages in typical and atypical neurodevelopment. A major focus of the research arm of the Service is to develop a comprehensive battery of sleep measurements as a mainstay of clinical assessment of children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Through our efforts with researchers from many different disciplines, we hope to create and initiate standardized protocols for collecting sleep data on children. To that end, the Service hosted a workshop to develop and promote Electrophysiologic Sleep Phenotyping (ESP) as a mainstay of the clinical assessment of children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. The online summary of that Workshop can be found at the following link (see: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/events/2017/sleep-and-neurodevelopment-workshop-electrophysiologic-sleep-phenotyping-esp.shtml) These protocols would include comprehensive behavioral assessments at the time of the sleep exam in order to best identify normal and abnormal developmental trajectories at the earliest possible opportunity.

NIMH Systems Neuroscience Imaging ResourceCurrent approaches to investigation of brain circuits and systems require analyses of neuronal projections, gene expression, and protein distribution patterns at cellular or greater resolution across multiple brain regions.  The Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource (SNIR) will make tools for systems level contemporary molecular anatomy accessible to NIMH and potentially other investigators. The SNIR will support investigation of circuits in the mouse and other species. This includes the implementation of advances in molecular anatomical methods in the marmoset and macaque.  A particular focus will be the facilitation of work incorporating advances in 3D reconstruction of specified circuits, cell types, and protein distributions, combining modern clearing, image acquisition, and volume reconstruction methods.The SNIR is intended to provide access to hardware, software, wet lab procedures, training, support and expertise surrounding histological preparation and microscopy. The SNIR will facilitate access to well established technologies such as high-throughput wide-field microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy. It will also facilitate the application of recently developed genetic, molecular, and imaging and analysis techniques to the projects and problems of intramural investigators. Evaluation of the tradeoffs between, and implementation of optimal combinations of, conventional sectioning approaches and clearing approaches will be an initial technical focus.Interactions between users and the SNIR will vary widely, based on project requirements and investigator expertise. Some investigators will have well developed procedures and simply need to use equipment. Orientation to specific equipment and time allocation will be provided. Training students and fellows in the techniques and procedures covered by the SNIR is expected to be a significant component of its work, followed by use of the equipment. Investigators may also wish to explore whether techniques such as tissue clearing or multiplex in situ hybridization will make valuable contributions to their work. SNIR staff will work closely with such investigators. The SNIR will also take on a small number of collaborations. These projects will generally be selected to advance a particular research project while also establishing procedures that will be of use to multiple investigators. Projected capabilities:1) Sectioning using sliding microtome, cryostat or vibratome.2) Tissue labeling with antibodies or nucleic acid probes, including multiplex in situ hybridization.3) Tissue clearing using CLARITY, CUBIC iDISCO and related techniques.4) Tissue imaging using conventional widefield illumination, including whole slide scanning, laser scanning confocal microscopy, and light sheet microscopy.5) Image processing, including deconvolution, brain reconstruction, alignment, registration and segmentation.6) Storage of, and online access to, image data.

This is the second year of operation of the Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource (SNIR). Much of the focus has been on equipment acquisition and procedure development.A Zeiss AxioscanZ1 slide scanning microscope is now in its second year of operation. This is a high quality widefield microscope with transmitted brightfield and fluorescent epi-illumination capacity. Its most significant feature is the ability to program multichannel tiled acquisition of large areas from up to 100 microscope slides. It is being actively used by investigators from 10 different intramural laboratories for projects that include whole brain mapping of gene expression profiles and the projections of genetically tagged and fluorescently labeled neuron populations. To improve throughput the illumination system was upgraded this year to a 7 channel LED system. There have been technical issues with evenness of illumination. The system continues to be used to capacity.A Zeiss LSM780 microscope is approximately 5 years old. It is a high quality inverted confocal microscope with 405, 488, 514, 561, 594 and 633 nm lasers, a 32-channel GaAsP based spectral detector and 2 conventional PMTs. It is generally used to capacity during core working hours by investigators from approximately 10 different NIMH intramural groups.A LaVision Ultrascope was acquired and installed this year. This is a light sheet microscope optimized for low magnification (1.2 to 12X 0.5 NA objective with a light sheet thickness minimum of 4 microns) imaging of large samples (up to approximately 10 x 10 x 6 mm). It has 405, 488, 552, 638, and 740 nm lasers. Whole mouse brains immunolabeled with the iDISCO technique are being imaged and projects using other types of material are under development. A Leica SP8 confocal/multiphoton system was acquired this year and is largely set up. It is on an upright microscope frame equipped and with long working distance dipping objectives designed for work with thick cleared samples. It is equipped with 405, 488, 552 and 638 nm fixed lasers and an Insight X3 tunable IR laser and both internal and external non-descanned PMT and HyD detectors. A Nikon C2 system is being set up for both widefield epillumination and laser scanning confocal imaging.  The microscope will provide alternatives to the Zeiss Axioscan and LSM780 that are being used to capacity. It will also provide the unique capacity to scan large areas in widefield mode at low or moderate magnification and to subsequently image regions of interest at high resolution and in confocal mode.Microbrightfield Brainmaker and Neurolucida 360 software packages are available to facilitate reconstruction and analysis of systems neuroscience data. A copy of Arivis Vision4D has been acquired and installed on a powerful PC workstation. Progress has been made on implementation of protocols for multiplex in situ hybridization on slabs of brain tissue up to 1mm thick.

The main goal is to maximize our efforts to provide statistical consulting to IRP investigators and to develop new statistical methods to meet the goals of the field of neuroscience. One basic example is that we have developed a method which can be used to analyze neuroimaging data and genomic data.The mission of the Statistical Genomics and Data Analysis Core is to support research to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through the application of the most effective statistical methods. The Core provides statistical services for intramural scientists through consultation, collaboration and on-site training. Furthermore, we aim to promote communication between intramural and extramural scientists through collaboration and on-site workshops at NIH. Specifically, we provide data quality control and data analysis using cutting edge statistical methods and our state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems.

Below we highlight two service projects which led to a publication. Example 1: Project Leaders - Lora Deuitch (PI: Robert Innis)The effects of expression of inflammatory markers on efflux transporters in drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy tissue. The goal of this project was to measure the expression of COX-1, COX-2, TSPO as well as P-gp, BCRP, in brain tissue samples from individuals with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical brain tissue was obtained from 33 participants with drug-resistant MTLE. Statistical significance for the expression of the inflammatory proteins amongst cell types was determined using Kruskal-Wallis test: (Dunns multiple comparison). To compare protein levels between the MTS and non-MTS groups, Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed. And logistic regression analysis was then performed to assess the association between MTS and the protein/cell expression with batch effect as a covariate. Pairwise linear correlations between ABC transporter and inflammatory protein expression were evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficients. COX-1 was expressed in microglia, and COX-2 and TSPO were expressed in microglia and neurons. BCRP density correlated significantly with TSPO density, suggesting a potential relationship between inflammatory markers and efflux transporters. It was the first study to measure the cellular expression of COX-1, COX-2, and TSPO in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in surgical brain tissue samples from individuals with drug-resistant MTLE. Further research is needed to determine the effects of the COX inflammatory pathway in epilepsy, and how it relates to the expression of the ABC transporters P-gp and BCRP. The work was published in Epilepsia (2018) and Dr. Kang, the Staff Scientist in the Core, was invited to be an author by the authors of the manuscript. Example 2: Project Leaders - PI: K. BermanHaploids calling in the 7q11.23 regions in individuals with Williams syndrome (WS)Dr. Bermans lab requested Dr. Yaos help to complete a R script to determine haploid and triploid genotypes and their association with vascular phenotypes in Williams syndrome and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome. Williams syndrome and 7q11.23 duplication syndrome (Dup7) show contrasting syndromic symptoms. However, within each group there is considerable interindividual variability in the degree to which these phenotypes are expressed. The existing software to identify areas of copy number variation (CNV) from SNP-chip data could not provide non-diploid genotypes in CNV regions. Dr. Yao offered critical advice and led to a development of a new method for identifying haploid and triploid genotypes in CNV regions. In Dr. Bermans samples, haploid calls in the 7q11.23 region were made for 99% of SNPs in the WS group, and triploid calls for 98.8% of SNPS in the individuals who carried Dup1. Furthermore, it was found that the G alleles of SNP rs2528795 in the ELN gene were associated with aortic stenosis in individuals with WS with a p-value of 0.0049. Interestingly, the A allele of the same SNP was associated with aortic dilation in DUP7. Therefore, the commonly available SNP-chip information can be used to make haploid and triploid calls in individuals with CNVs and be related to variability in specific genes to variability in syndromic phenotypes using the aortic arteriopathy phenotype. The work was published in BMC Med Genet. in 2018.In addition to collaborating with other laboratories within NIH, we designed and conducted a basic statistics course focused on brain science. This course was aimed at both intramural research trainees (including post-baccalaureate fellows and post-doctoral fellows) that were interested in learning basic statistical tools that could apply to their research. And it was well received.Independent and Collaborative ResearchWe collaborated with multiple investigators from Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, Brown University, University of California and University of Los Angeles. Together, we conducted a meta-analysis for two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). We discovered new genes/SNPs that are associated with OCD. To detail, we investigated a total of 2688 individuals of European ancestry with OCD and 7037 gnomically matched controls. No single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reached genome-wide significance. However, in comparison with the two individual GWASs, the distribution of P-values shifted toward significance. The top haplotypic blocks were tagged with rs4733767 (P=7.1 10-7; odds ratio (OR)=1.21; confidence interval (CI): 1.12-1.31, CASC8/CASC11), rs1030757 (P=1.1 10-6; OR=1.18; CI: 1.10-1.26, GRID2) and rs12504244 (P=1.6 10-6; OR=1.18; CI: 1.11-1.27, KIT). Variants located in or near the genes ASB13, RSPO4, DLGAP1, PTPRD, GRIK2, FAIM2 and CDH20, identified in linkage peaks and the original GWASs, were among the top signals. Polygenic risk scores for each individual study predicted case-control status in the other by explaining 0.9% (P=0.003) and 0.3% (P=0.0009) of the phenotypic variance in OCGAS and the European IOCDF-GC target samples, respectively. The common SNP heritability in the combined OCGAS and IOCDF-GC sample was estimated to be 0.28 (s.e.=0.04). Strikingly, 65% of the SNP-based heritability in the OCGAS sample was accounted for by SNPs with minor allele frequencies of 40%.In addition, we also examined the allele frequency distribution of the common variation heritability of OCD. Albeit the fact that the confidence intervals of each allele frequency bin are large because of the limited sample sizes, the majority of the heritability (65%) was accounted for by SNPs with high MAF (for example, >40%) in both the OCGAS sample and combined sample. Although there were no genome-wide significant findings, the 53.7kb haplotype block encompassing the top SNP, rs4733767, contains 25 H3K27Ac peaks in the ENCODE/ROADMAP data, suggesting it has regulatory potential. This meta-study, to some extent, shed light to the complex genetic architecture of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The main goal is to maximize our efforts to provide statistical consulting to IRP investigators and to develop new statistical methods to meet the goals of the field of neuroscience. One basic example is that we have developed a method which can be used to analyze neuroimaging data and genomic data.The mission of the Statistical Genomics and Data Analysis Core is to support research to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through the application of the most effective statistical methods. The Core provides statistical services for intramural scientists through consultation, collaboration and on-site training. Furthermore, we aim to promote communication between intramural and extramural scientists through collaboration and on-site workshops at NIH. Specifically, we provide data quality control and data analysis using cutting edge statistical methods and our state-of-the-art high-performance computing systems.

The mission of the Machine Learning Team (MLT) is to support researchers in the NIMH intramural research program (IRP) who want to address research problems in clinical and cognitive neuroscience using machine learning approaches. We do this by consulting with individual researchers and guiding them in the use of the appropriate tools and methods, or by taking on the analysis process ourselves, if this is more expedient. In parallel, we develop new methods and analysis approaches, motivated by the needs of researchers or by the practical possibilities arising from advances in the field. We are also in the process of developing training activities on basic machine learning for dissemination to a wider audience within the NIMH IRP, since there is strong interest from trainees and principal investigators (PIs).

This is the first annual report for the Machine Learning Team. We have only been fully operational since January of 2018, when Francisco Pereira was hired. Charles Zheng and Patrick McClure were hired late in 2017, and worked within the Data Science and Sharing Team (DSST) until January. In 2018, the team hosted summer interns Nao Rho and Tim Barry.In our first few months, we concentrated on setting up the hardware and computational infrastructure for the team, and starting collaborations that were particularly well matched to our skills and interests. We also canvassed many individual researchers and trainees to understand their needs, as that is crucial for guiding our future activities.  Over the coming months, we plan to release software packages we have been working on, after testing and  documentation. Beyond that, we plan to prioritize the development of training material and workshops, in order to be able to have an impact on the work of more labs through their trainees and staff scientists. We will, in parallel, continue working on specific projects that lend themselves to the development of new methods, and joint high-impact efforts with the DSST.  Development of novel methods One of the obstacles to the use of machine learning methods on very large datasets is the fact that many of these datasets may not be shared outside their site of origin, due to IRB constraints, sheer scale, or other factors. We developed a new method to allow the combination of prediction models -- Bayesian deep neural networks -- trained in different datasets from different sites into a single prediction model, with performance comparable to what would be obtained by having all the data in one location.  In order to study the mental representation of concrete concepts, colleagues in the NIMH IRP are collecting vast datasets of behavioral judgments. We developed a new method for creating models of mental representations that can predict the behavior of participants in face of new stimuli not used in building the model, or on a variety of new tasks. Both of these projects have led to submitted publications (see below). Development of software packages We developed several software packages that were necessary for us or for the colleagues we collaborated with:1) searchlight classification/regression models -  the purpose is to produce maps of where certain information is present in brain imaging data, as measured by the ability to predict it from new images.2) common latent variable models -  the purpose is to wrap up several methods for identifying brain activation that is common across subjects exposed to the same stimuli, and automatically select parameter values from the data, to make the methods easier to use.3) agglomerative clustering  the purpose is to generate a brain parcellation in a completely data-driven way, by grouping adjacent voxels with similar behavior, and determining which parcels are reliable in different groups of subjects.In all three cases, our goal is to have the methods working fast enough to make it feasible to use them on very high-resolution functional MRI data from a 7 Tesla scanner.Collaboration with IRP researchers We have been helping researchers at NIMH and NINDS in projects that require machine learning tools, for instance:- automated prediction of brain segmentations (in second rather than hours)- creation of a model of mental representations of objects that explains complex behavior - identification of brain locations encoding a percept from high-resolution functional brain imaging data - detection of locations and times in a video stimulus containing information about subject decision- comparison of group-level testing methods for information mapping in functional brain imaging - comparison of the efficacy of different dynamic functional connectivity methods to capture cognitively relevant information- creation of a parcellation of the hypothalamus from very high resolution functional brain imaging data- prediction of the improvement of stroke patients after one year of follow-up, based on their condition at discharge and demographics, lab tests, treatment, and several other factors - generating predictors for naturalistic stimuli using deep neural networks- prediction of subject characteristics from functional brain imaging data acquired while seeing naturalistic stimuli- identification of groups of neurons driving different aspects of animal behavior, from calcium imaging data- prediction of the temporal evolution trajectory of schizophrenia patients from SNP genetic data- automatic annotation of video frames in movies to identify all body parts present, to allow quantification of eye tracking patterns in ASD patients and control subjects- identification of aspects of functional connectivity that distinguish patients with motor disorders from control subjects- prediction of patient HIV status from a variety of imaging and non-imaging measuresIn addition to these projects, we also provided informal guidance to researchers already using machine learning methods, in NIMH, NINDS, NIDA, NIAAA, and NCBI.Education and TrainingWe hosted the following talks as part of the Machine Learning in Brain Imaging and Neuroscience seminar:- 1/30 - Yoshua Bengio - AI and Deep Learning- 2/27 - Adam Marblestone - Towards integration of Deep Learning and Neuroscience, - 3/20 - Nikolaus Kriegeskorte -  Modeling brain processing with Deep Learning + Representational Similarity Analysis- 4/25 - Aude Oliva - Comparison of deep neuronal networks to spatio-temporal cortical dynamics of human visual object recognition- 5/16 -  Francisco Pereira - Toward universal decoders of semantic content from brain imaging- 8/23 - Vince Calhoun -  Deep Learning Approaches: Brief Introduction and Application to NeuroimagingWe gave additional presentations within and outside NIMH:- 3/16 -  Francisco Pereira - invited presentation at the Center for Brain, Behavior, and Cognition at Pennsylvania State University.- 2/9 - Patrick McClure - presentation and deep learning Q&A at the NCBI Deep Learning Journal Club- 7/3 - Patrick McClure - presentation on deep unsupervised learning at the NIH Image Segmentation Journal Club- 7/28 - Francisco Pereira - invited presentation at the Data-Intensive Brain Imaging: The State of the Art symposium at the Cognitive Science conference- 9/20-21 - Francisco Pereira - invited presentations at the University of Porto, PortugalArticles under review:Zheng, C.; Achanta, R.; Benjamini, Y.

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Division of Intramural Programs (IRP) is charged with promoting innovative basic, clinical, and translational research to advance understanding of the diagnosis, causes, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders through the study of brain development, function and behavior. The NIMH Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) assists the Scientific Director in the planning and implementation of new scientific directions within the NIMH IRP. While providing critical clinical research infrastructure to NIMH investigators, the OCD also serves as an important liaison to the NIH Clinical Center (CC) and the NIH community at large through administrative advocacy of NIMH priorities and by providing mental health expertise and services. The mission of the OCD is to support and maintain a complex dynamic clinical research enterprise. This is accomplished through OCD oversight of many activities including the Human Subjects Protections Unit (HSPU), Marketing and Recruitment, Patient Safety and Quality, Clinical and Regulatory Oversight, Clinical Training programs, and the Psychiatric Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS). In addition, the clinicians within the OCD conduct research that supports the NIMH mission.

CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT SERVICES: A central mission of the OCD is to ensure that research participants receive the highest quality clinical care. The OCD is responsible for oversight of all clinical aspects of the NIMH Intramural Research Program (NIMH IRP). HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTIONS:  The mission of the Human Subject Protections Unit (HSPU) is to ensure the protection of vulnerable subjects participating in research and to educate researchers and participants. This team works with investigators, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the Clinical Center (CC) Bioethics Department to identify and ameliorate risks for vulnerable subjects. Responsibilities include: 1) Consent and Assent Monitoring which assesses the quality of the informed consent process and ensures that all of the required elements of the protocol are discussed with participants.  Assent monitoring ensures the quality of the assent discussion and verifies the agreement of the subject to participate in research. 2) Subject Monitoring of all NIMH inpatients verifies ongoing informed consent over the course of their participation to assess current wishes, understanding, and concerns regarding continued participation in research. 3) Capacity Assessment is a clinical assessment of an adult participant's ability to provide informed consent for a specific protocol. For select high-risk studies, a capacity assessment must be completed prior to study participation. 4) Ability to Appoint an NIH Advanced Directive/Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) Assessment determines a participant's ability to choose another person to be his/her decision-maker for research participation. 5) Appropriateness of the Surrogate Assessment determines the appointed surrogate decision-maker's ability to represent a participant's wishes and provide consent. 6) Training and Education: The HSPU developed and conducts the Elements of a Successful Consent, a required training for investigators obtaining informed consent. To date, over 1200 NIH staff have completed this training. This training is also available as a computer-based training program. The HSPU provides customized presentations and trainings to meet the specific human subject protection needs of individual research teams at NIH. In response to inquiries from other institutions, the HSPU has developed a toolkit to assist research organizations to assess, develop and implement appropriate levels of human subjects protections at their own facilities. The MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS AND RECRUITMENT UNIT (MCRU) facilitates comprehensive and diverse NIMH patient recruitment through design and materials development, targeted marketing and advertising planning, and community outreach. In FY18, our Community Outreach Program reached over 14,000 individuals through over 200 meetings with providers, consumers, community members, 34 scientific seminars, and electronic mailings. PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY (PSQ): In 2016, the OCD established the Office of Patient Safety and Quality. The Clinical Director, along with other OCD staff, oversees NIMH quality improvement initiatives and meets with branch/section/lab chiefs and managers to assist with designing patient safety and quality improvement initiatives, with a dual focus of improving and ensuring quality clinical care, and sharing their experiences with the larger NIMH intramural clinical care group during monthly PSQ meetings. The OCD also tracks and trends Clinical Center occurrences and ensures follow-up. The OCD sends representatives to Clinical Center safety and quality initiatives, including daily patient safety huddles, the hospital-wide Clinical Care and Quality meeting, and the Patient Safety Clinical Practice and Quality Committee. NIMH monthly safety meetings for basic science labs are also attended by an OCD representative. Each branch/lab/section has presented at least one PSQ project and is now being scheduled to present follow up findings for their ongoing continuous quality improvement projects.The OCD PSQ team has also established a method for assisting the NIMH Clinical Director with recredentialing medical staff.  The Medical Re-Credentialing Evaluation (MRCE) allows medical staff to self-evaluate and select peers for evaluations as well.  The MRCE project has served as model for the Clinical Center leadership who is adopting a similar program that will soon be implemented hospital-wide.CLINICAL OVERSIGHT: The OCD team meets regularly with medical and nursing leadership to review Clinical Center (CC) census (which increased for NIMH in 2018), discuss clinical concerns and plan for future initiatives. The monthly PSQ meeting is also a forum for communication of hospital-related policies and regulations and includes quality improvement projects from each branch/section. The OCD team has coordinated the hospital-wide implementation of suicide risk screening at the CC in response to a Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert 56 calling for suicide risk screening of all medical patients in the hospital setting (see ZIA MH002922-10). The OCD is responsible for reviewing the qualifications of all clinical personnel and is involved in maintaining the clinical competence of all NIMH health care professionals. The OCD serves as the link between the CC hospital and the Institute. The OCD is responsible for the implementation of CC policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The OCD participates in annual CC budget planning meetings with the CC and IC Directors and coordinates hospital initiatives such as preparation for Joint Commission accreditation visits, annual flu shot compliance, etc. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT: The Office for Regulatory Oversight (ORO) focuses on compliance with regulatory requirements and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This office coordinates the scientific review of new and ongoing protocols and provides protocol navigation services to NIMH IRP investigators. The navigation team provides direct support to investigators for all aspects of IRB submissions and tracking of investigator trainings. The OCD has implemented genetic data sharing and data sharing plans for intramural studies in accordance with NIH policy. The OCD coordinates a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to oversee DIRP protocols. Two clinical monitors develop and implement individualized monitoring plans for all active NIMH IRP protocols. This team also provides training and develops corrective action plans as needed. TRAINING AND EDUCATION: The NIMH OCD works in partnership with the NIMH Office of Fellowship Training (OFT) and the Office of Clinical Research and Training in Medical Education (OCRTME) to oversee and participate in several programs that train and educate new physicians and medical students. In addition, the NIMH OCD contributes to initiatives that identify and promote academic research careers among promising early career psychiatrists. See OCD Training report ZIEMH002939-06 for additional details. CONSULTATION LIAISON: The NIMH Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS) and Neuropsychology Consultation Service are teams that provide multidisciplinary clinical services to patients enrolled in clinical protocols at the NIH CC. Two additional clinical services were added in 2017, the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service (see Dr. Thurm's report ZIC-MH002961-02) and the Sleep and Neurodevelopment Service (see Dr. Buckley's report ZIC-MH002962-02).

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Division of Intramural Programs (IRP) is charged with promoting innovative basic, clinical, and translational research to advance understanding of the diagnosis, causes, treatment, and prevention of mental disorders through the study of brain development, function and behavior. The NIMH Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) assists the Scientific Director in the planning and implementation of new scientific directions within the NIMH IRP. While providing critical clinical research infrastructure to NIMH investigators, the OCD also serves as an important liaison to the NIH Clinical Center (CC) and the NIH community at large through administrative advocacy of NIMH priorities and by providing mental health expertise and services. The mission of the OCD is to support and maintain a complex dynamic clinical research enterprise. This is accomplished through OCD oversight of many activities including the Human Subjects Protections Unit (HSPU), Marketing and Recruitment, Patient Safety and Quality, Clinical and Regulatory Oversight, Clinical Training programs, and the Psychiatric Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS). In addition, the clinicians within the OCD conduct research that supports the NIMH mission.

CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT SERVICES: A central mission of the OCD is to ensure that research participants receive the highest quality clinical care. The OCD is responsible for oversight of all clinical aspects of the NIMH Intramural Research Program (NIMH IRP). HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTIONS:  The mission of the Human Subject Protections Unit (HSPU) is to ensure the protection of vulnerable subjects participating in research and to educate researchers and participants. This team works with investigators, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the Clinical Center (CC) Bioethics Department to identify and ameliorate risks for vulnerable subjects. Responsibilities include: 1) Consent and Assent Monitoring which assesses the quality of the informed consent process and ensures that all of the required elements of the protocol are discussed with participants.  Assent monitoring ensures the quality of the assent discussion and verifies the agreement of the subject to participate in research. 2) Subject Monitoring of all NIMH inpatients verifies ongoing informed consent over the course of their participation to assess current wishes, understanding, and concerns regarding continued participation in research. 3) Capacity Assessment is a clinical assessment of an adult participant's ability to provide informed consent for a specific protocol. For select high-risk studies, a capacity assessment must be completed prior to study participation. 4) Ability to Appoint an NIH Advanced Directive/Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) Assessment determines a participant's ability to choose another person to be his/her decision-maker for research participation. 5) Appropriateness of the Surrogate Assessment determines the appointed surrogate decision-maker's ability to represent a participant's wishes and provide consent. 6) Training and Education: The HSPU developed and conducts the Elements of a Successful Consent, a required training for investigators obtaining informed consent. To date, over 1200 NIH staff have completed this training. This training is also available as a computer-based training program. The HSPU provides customized presentations and trainings to meet the specific human subject protection needs of individual research teams at NIH. In response to inquiries from other institutions, the HSPU has developed a toolkit to assist research organizations to assess, develop and implement appropriate levels of human subjects protections at their own facilities. The MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS AND RECRUITMENT UNIT (MCRU) facilitates comprehensive and diverse NIMH patient recruitment through design and materials development, targeted marketing and advertising planning, and community outreach. In FY18, our Community Outreach Program reached over 14,000 individuals through over 200 meetings with providers, consumers, community members, 34 scientific seminars, and electronic mailings. PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY (PSQ): In 2016, the OCD established the Office of Patient Safety and Quality. The Clinical Director, along with other OCD staff, oversees NIMH quality improvement initiatives and meets with branch/section/lab chiefs and managers to assist with designing patient safety and quality improvement initiatives, with a dual focus of improving and ensuring quality clinical care, and sharing their experiences with the larger NIMH intramural clinical care group during monthly PSQ meetings. The OCD also tracks and trends Clinical Center occurrences and ensures follow-up. The OCD sends representatives to Clinical Center safety and quality initiatives, including daily patient safety huddles, the hospital-wide Clinical Care and Quality meeting, and the Patient Safety Clinical Practice and Quality Committee. NIMH monthly safety meetings for basic science labs are also attended by an OCD representative. Each branch/lab/section has presented at least one PSQ project and is now being scheduled to present follow up findings for their ongoing continuous quality improvement projects.The OCD PSQ team has also established a method for assisting the NIMH Clinical Director with recredentialing medical staff.  The Medical Re-Credentialing Evaluation (MRCE) allows medical staff to self-evaluate and select peers for evaluations as well.

The NIMH Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) in the Division of Intramural Research Programs (IRP) works in partnership with the NIMH Office of Fellowship Training, the NIH Office of Clinical Research and Training in Medical Education (OCRTME) and the NIH Clinical Center Graduate Medical Education Committee (GMEC) to oversee and participate in programs that: provide training for qualified physicians who intend to pursue scientific research careers; allow advanced psychiatry residents to jump start their research training; and educate medical students, residents, and fellows about clinical research. The NIMH OCD contributes to NIMH national initiatives to identify and promote academic research careers among early career psychiatrists. In addition, the OCD organizes scientific programs that educate psychiatrists about cutting edge research on serious mental illness and clinical neuroscience.PGY4 Psychiatry Residency and Clinical Fellowship ProgramsSince 1954, the NIMH IRP has supported training programs considered to be a national resource for physicians seeking intensive research training in psychiatry and clinical neuroscience. There are two programs offered, both of which are full-time three-year positions. One is a post-residency clinical fellowship for highly motivated and qualified MD and MD-PhDs; and the other is a one-year Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited fourth post-graduate year (PGY4) residency program for current psychiatry residents who later become clinical fellows. Residents and fellows are recruited nationally from many of the top psychiatry residency programs in the United States. The residency and fellowship programs select trainees with excellent clinical psychiatry skills, strong research background, and commitment to a research career. The research training programs are mentorship driven and individually tailored. Skills are developed through close interactions with mentors and hands on research experiences. Residents and fellows join specialty research groups that study mechanisms or treatments of major mental illnesses in adults and children. Emphasis in these programs is on psychopharmacology; novel therapeutics; behavioral endocrinology; neurobiology; neurodevelopment; functional, structural and molecular brain imaging; and neurogenetics. Each fellow/resident writes an Individualized Development Plan that defines their specific goals and activities.

Clinical Fellowship Programs: During FY18, there were nine NIMH IRP residents/fellows. The academic year generally starts in July so this number includes new, current and departing trainees in our programs. Of the nine trainees, three entered through our PGY-4 ACGME accredited psychiatry residency program at some point in the year. We added three new trainees in FY18, two PGY-4 residents and one clinical fellow. In addition, three clinical fellows departed in the past year.PGY4 Psychiatry Residency: The NIMH residency program is a unique one-year program that provides nearly full-time research training while at the same time fulfilling the ACGME requirements of the fourth year of residency. Psychiatry residents who transfer to the program have completed all required clinical rotations prior to coming to NIMH. Administrative duties: The Program Director for the PGY4 residency and clinical fellowship program is currently serving as the Chair of the NIH Graduate Medical Education Committee (GMEC). The NIMH OCD appoints a clinical fellow to the Clinical Fellows Committee of the NIH Clinical Center and has a PGY4 representative as well. Other affiliated training programsNIH Clinical Center Hospice and Palliative Medicine fellowship program: this accredited program is sponsored by the NIMH ACGME-approved PGY4 psychiatry residency. The two programs work together to support the clinical training of fellows by joint conferences and clinical interactions.Psychosomatic Medicine (PM) fellowship program: this one year ACGME-accredited subspecialty fellowship is conducted in partnership with Georgetown University Medical Center and Washington Hospital Center and has two fellowship positions per year. The PM fellows rotate on the NIMH Psychiatric Consultation Liaison Service at the NIH Clinical Center, each for six months. The fellowship program will undergo a name change this year in accordance with a name change of the subspecialty to Consultation Liaison Psychiatry (CLP).Research electives for psychiatry residents and child psychiatry fellows: There were three residents/fellows from local training programs who rotated to NIMH for research electives: two child fellows from Georgetown University, and one general psychiatry resident from St. Elizabeths. Medical Student Programs:The Clinical Electives Program (CEP) at the NIH Clinical Center provides fourth year medical students with direct exposure to the conduct of clinical research after completion of their core medical school clinical rotations. The OCD helps coordinate medical student rotations in Adult Psychopharmacology, and Psychosomatic Medicine/Consultation Liaison Psychiatry; other elective options are available on request.Medical Research Scholars Program (MRSP) at the NIH Clinical Center is a selective year-long elective research year for medical students who live and work on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Deputy Clinical Director and NIMH IRP faculty have served as mentors or been on the MRSP Board of Advisors. Advisors interview and select students for the program and help them identify an appropriate research mentor. Clinical Neuroscience Initiatives:The OCD oversees two NIMH national initiatives (ORAP and Brain Camp) that promote psychiatrists-in-training to choose and succeed in clinical neuroscience research as well as conferences that promote neuroscience education for psychiatrists.The NIMH Outstanding Resident Award Program (ORAP) was started in 1988 and is a highly coveted and competitive annual award for promising young psychiatrists-in-training. The ORAP awardees are psychiatry residents with outstanding academic potential who are selected from among the top residencies in the U.S. and who have been nominated by their training directors. This award is given to a small number of residents each year for past achievements, current efforts, and future contributions to the field of psychiatry. In fall 2017, 11 award recipients and 5 honorable mention residents traveled to Bethesda for a two-day program that featured presentations by NIMH investigators, extramural program staff and a tour of NIMH facilities. In June 2018, a new group of 9 ORAP residents was selected with 7 honorable mentions.NIMH Brain Camp is an annual scientific retreat for psychiatry trainees with a strong background and interest in research careers. The program, started in 2009, involves lectures and discussions between residents, invited distinguished faculty and NIMH leadership, on a variety of cutting edge neuroscience topics relevant to psychiatry. A successful Brain Camp program, led by NIMH Director, Joshua Gordon, was held from April 13-15, 2018 with a two year cohort of ORAP recipients at the Banbury Center in Cold Spring Harbor, NY. The OCD participates at national meetings on the topic of education in neuroscience and research training. The Program Director of the PGY4 residency and clinical fellowship program was a faculty member for the BRAIN pre-conference at the February 2018 American Association of Directors of Psychiatry Residency Programs (AADPRT) annual meeting during which newly developed NIMH-funded neuroscience curriculum modules were taught and disseminated. The OCD helped organize a NIMH Research Track within the American Psychiatric Association annual meeting (May 5-9, 2018) on behalf of the NIMH Director. The conference included a plenary lecture by the NIMH Director as well as five symposia that highlighted NIMH funded research. Trans-NIH Initiatives:The NIMH Office of the Clinical Director spearheaded a collaborative project with NIH Intramural Research Program stakeholders to develop and disseminate materials about how best to serve and manage the distressed trainee in the workplace. The Toolkit includes information about how, where, and under what circumstances to access resources to proactively manage professional challenges, work-life balance, cultural adaptation, mental health issues, conflict resolution, crisis intervention and emergency response. These materials have been widely disseminated within NIH and specifically to graduate medical trainees to address issues of physician wellness.

NIMH intramural scientists conduct research ranging from studies into the mechanisms of normal brain function at the behavioral, systems, cellular, and molecular levels, to clinical investigations into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illness. Researchers study conditions in adults and children such as anxiety, depressive, bipolar, attention deficit hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders, as well as schizophrenia. Approaches include experimental therapeutics; functional and molecular imaging; genetics; behavioral, cognitive, molecular and cellular neuroscience; and epidemiology. In part, because of its state-of-the-art facilities, unique funding mechanisms, and location near the nation's capital, the intramural research program (IRP) is viewed as a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research and research training.Susan G. Amara, Ph.D., serves as the Scientific Director and provides oversight to a diverse mental health research portfolio that includes clinical projects on autism spectrum disorder, women's health, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood and anxiety disorders; and basic projects geared toward answering fundamental questions related to mental health in the areas of cognition, genetics, learning and memory, and behavior. In FY2016, six new principal investigators (PIs) and an adjunct investigator joined the NIMH IRP. In FY2017, two more PIs began new research groups, and two independent clinical services and a cellular and anatomical imaging resource were established. In FY2018, renovations were undertaken to support the research of four of these new PIs, including a new electrophysiology lab, a two-photon microscope room, and behavior testing rooms. Five core facilities required renovations/expansions of lab and/or office space.  And design and renovation began in preparation for an additional new tenure-track PI joining at the end of FY2018.
