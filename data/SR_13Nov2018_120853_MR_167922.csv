"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Mental Health;Neurosciences","We have just started our adventure. We are currently setting up a temporary physiology rig in our temporary space, hoping to -at least- start training of animals before the permanent lab space gets ready. The protocol for the research in NCB is submitted. Two postbacs are hired and two postdocs are lined up to join the lab in Jan 2018. The mechanical structures needed for the physiology rigs are nearly ready and we will start populating them with electronics soon. The main lab space with full equipment is scheduled to be ready by Dec 1st. While we need the main lab space for most of our experiments we will use the temporary space to train the animals and potentially collect some data until the main space is ready. Our full performance is highly dependent on the timely completion of the labs construction.","Animals;Area;Behavior;Brain;Data;electrical microstimulation;Electronics;Equipment;Event;experimental study;Goals;Inferior;Measures;Mechanics;Microinjections;Muscimol;Neurons;object recognition;optogenetics;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Postdoctoral Fellow;Primates;Protocols documentation;Psychophysics;relating to nervous system;Research;Schedule;Stream;Structure;Temporal Lobe;Time;Training;Visual Perception;visual processing;","UNIT ON NEURONS; CIRCUITS AND BEHAVIOR",n/a,"NIMH","9568286","","",1ZIAMH002958-01,1,ZIA,MH,002958,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15226858","AFRAZ, ARASH ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,638771,

Researchers study conditions in adults and children such as anxiety, depressive, bipolar, attention deficit hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders, as well as schizophrenia.  Approaches include experimental therapeutics; functional and molecular imaging; genetics; behavioral, cognitive, molecular and cellular neuroscience; and epidemiology. In part, because of its state-of-the-art facilities, unique funding mechanisms, and location in the nation's capital, the IRP is viewed as a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research and research training.Susan G. Amara, Ph.D., serves as the Scientific Director for the NIMH IRP and provides oversight to a diverse mental health research portfolio that includes clinical projects on autism, women's health, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood and anxiety disorders; and basic projects geared toward answering fundamental questions related to mental health in the areas of cognition, genetics, learning and memory, and behavior. The portfolio also includes projects aimed at exploring new technologies and approaches to neuroscience such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG).  The Scientific Director provides supplemental resources, as appropriate, to research projects in the IRP portfolio.In FY2017, two new principal investigators (PIs) joined the NIMH IRP. The Office of the Scientific Director (OSD) continued to support collaborative activities within NIMH and with other NIH institutes, including collaborative research projects involving three or more PIs, and several scientific workshops and seminar series. The OSD also continued to host the seminar series called, 'New Discoveries in Mental Health Research.' The purpose of the seminar series is to help intramural scientists to learn more about innovative extramural research that is relevant to the NIMH mission, and to build new relationships with investigators outside of the Intramural Research Program.","Adult;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Area;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Attentional deficit;autism spectrum disorder;Autistic Disorder;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavioral;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;brain behavior;Capital;Child;Clinical;clinical care;clinical development;clinical investigation;Clinical Research;Cognition;Cognitive;Complement;Congresses;depressive symptoms;Diagnosis;Doctor of Philosophy;Educational workshop;Ensure;Environment;Epidemiology;Ethics;experience;Extramural Activities;Fostering;Functional Imaging;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding Mechanisms;Genetic;Hyperactive behavior;imaging genetics;innovation;Institutes;interest;Intramural Research Program;Investigational Therapies;Leadership;Learning;Location;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Magnetoencephalography;member;Memory;Mental Depression;mental disorder prevention;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Mission;Molecular;molecular imaging;Mood Disorders;National Institute of Mental Health;Neurosciences;new technology;novel;novel strategies;Prevention;Principal Investigator;Public Health;Recovery;Research;Research Activity;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Subjects;Research Training;Resources;Schizophrenia;Science;Scientist;Series;System;Thinking;Training;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Women's Health;","OFFICE OF THE SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR",n/a,"NIMH","9589758","","",1ZIAMH002917-10,1,ZIA,MH,002917,10,,Unavailable,"","","",,"11999773","AMARA, SUSAN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,4355537,
"Mental Health;Neurosciences","Our laboratory has shown that amphetamines trigger the internalization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by a series of intracellular events that are distinct from the generally established actions of amphetamines to inhibit dopamine (DA) uptake or to increase DA efflux. We have found that when applied to cell lines, cultured DA neurons or midbrain slices, amphetamine activates the small GTPases, RhoA and Rac-1 and triggers internalization of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by a specialized internalization pathway that requires the activation of the small GTPase, RhoA. Intriguingly, amphetamine must be transported into the cell to have these effects and its actions are actually blocked by cocaine, a drug that inhibits DAT and prevents amphetamine entry. We have also found that elevation of cAMP, via DA receptors or by amphetamine-induced adenylate cyclase activation, inactivates RhoA and limits carrier internalization, consistent with roles for PKA- and Rho-dependent signaling in mediating the actions of amphetamines in dopamine neurons. Our observations have also suggested the existence of a novel intracellular target for amphetamines and suggest new cellular pathways to target in order to disrupt amphetamine action. In recent studies we have established that a G-protein coupled trace amine receptor (TAAR1) serves as a direct intracellular target for amphetamines in dopamine neurons. Using transgenic mouse lines lacking the TAAR1 receptor we have shown that the intracellular effects of amphetamine, including both the elevation in cAMP and the increased RhoA activity, depend absolutely upon TAAR1 activation. We have shown that the when activated by amphetamine within the cell, TAAR1 couple through a G-protein alpha subunit, known as G13, and we have continued our efforts to identify the subcellular compartment where TAAR1 signaling takes place.  Using a series of subcellularly-targeted genetic sensors to detect  RhoA or cAMP activation, we have been able to demonstrate that TAAR1 signaling initiates in an intracellular membrane compartment that is within or very proximal to the endoplasmic reticulum. We have also observed that the same amphetamine-activated RhoA-dependent mechanism downregulates a glutamate transporter, EAAT3, present on the surface of dopamine neurons. We have identified the EAAT3 peptide sequence responsible for this regulation, generated a cell-permeant fusion protein that blocks internalization and have used it to explore the effects of amphetamine on excitatory neurotransmission in brain slices and in vivo, using targeted viral expression. These studies have provided new tools to distinguish the effects of amphetamine on dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling. We have also compared the effects of various amphetamine compounds on the activation of cellular signaling pathways. Comparison of the effects of methamphetamine on glutamate transport activity to those of amphetamine indicate that while both treatments lead to a loss of cell-surface EAAT3, the effects of methamphetamine are much broader and do not depend on the expression of the DAT. These findings provide an explanation for the broader, more devastating effects of methamphetamine: unlike amphetamine, methamphetamine has the capacity to alter EAAT3 surface expression and regulate excitatory neurotransmission, not only in dopamine neurons, but also in many other neuronal cell types within the brain.  In other studies within the group we have shown that G-protein beta-gamma subunits released when G-protein-coupled receptors are activated bind directly to the DAT and enhance dopamine efflux in cultured cells and in vivo. Using cell permeable peptide fragments and mutagenesis of the DAT we have been able to define the transporter domains required for this interaction and to develop structural models for how this interaction may facilitate dopamine efflux by the transporter. Our work has demonstrated that release of G-beta-gamma subunits triggered by endogenous receptor activation is sufficient to enhance DA efflux in cultured cells and neurons. Most recently we have shown that the G-beta-gamma subunit drives the transporter into a novel conformation that facilitates dopamine efflux through a novel pathway that appears distinct from the pathway for sodium and chloride coupled transport.Glutamate transporters (also known as excitatory amino acid transporters or EAATs) present at the surface of neurons and supporting glial cells regulate the extracellular concentration of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. By transporting glutamate back into the cell, these carrier proteins prevent glutamate from reaching toxic levels and also limit the extent and duration of transmitter signaling during glutamatergic neurotransmission. These carriers have an additional function in that they possess an anion channel activity that can regulate cellular excitability, which enables them to serve as sensors of glutamate levels outside the cell. Our laboratory has used site-directed mutagenesis, sulfhydryl modification, and chemical cross-linking approaches together with biochemical, and electrophysiological analyses of the mammalian carriers to examine the structural domains required for substrate transport and ion permeation. Recent work has been directed at understanding the mechanism and structural basis of anion channel activation. We initially identified a positively-charged arginine residue in transmembrane domain 7 as an essential element in the anion channel gating mechanism. Substitution of this residue with a negatively-charged amino acid, eliminates sodium- and substrate-dependent anion channel gating, and drives the channel into a substrate-independent constitutively open state. Using a computationally-derived homology model we identified a larger network of charged residues that are required to stabilize the closed state of the channel and, when examined experimentally, appear to be intrinsic elements of the channel gating mechanism. Overall, our data suggest that anion channel gating occurs through a transition from intermediate conformations that are closely linked to transport.","Adenylate Cyclase;Alpha Cell;Amination;Amines;Amino Acids;Amphetamines;Anions;Antidepressive Agents;Arginine;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Back;Binding;Biochemical;Biogenic Amines;Biological;Brain;Carrier Proteins;Cell Line;Cell membrane;Cell physiology;Cell surface;cell type;Cells;Charge;Chemicals;Chimeric Proteins;Cocaine;Coupled;crosslink;Cultured Cells;Cyclic AMP;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Data;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;dopamine transporter;dopaminergic neuron;Drug effect disorder;EAAT3;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Event;Excitatory Amino Acids;extracellular;Family;G-protein Beta gamma;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;G-substrate;Genetic;Glutamate Transporter;glutamatergic signaling;Glutamates;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs;Homology Modeling;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;Intracellular Membranes;Ion Channel;Ions;Laboratories;Lead;Link;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Methamphetamine;methamphetamine effect;Methylphenidate;Midbrain structure;Modification;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Genetics;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Movement;Mutagenesis;Neuroglia;neuronal excitability;Neurons;neurotransmission;neurotransmitter reuptake;Neurotransmitters;novel;Pathway interactions;Peptide Fragments;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;prevent;Property;protein aminoacid sequence;receptor;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Research;reuptake;rho;Role;sensor;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site-Directed Mutagenesis;Slice;Sodium;Sodium Chloride;Structural Models;Structure;subcellular targeting;Surface;System;Therapeutic;tool;Transgenic Mice;Transmembrane Domain;uptake;Viral;Work;","STRUCTURE; FUNCTION AND PHARMACOLOGY OF NEUROTRANSMITTER REUPTAKE SYSTEMS",n/a,"NIMH","9589761","","",1ZIAMH002946-05,1,ZIA,MH,002946,05,,Unavailable,"","","",,"11999773","AMARA, SUSAN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2631642,

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Depression;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Our lab uses a combination of neurophysiology, pharmacology and imaging to understand how a set of brain areas composed of the amygdala, ventral-striatum, prefrontal cortical areas and dopamine underlie learning.  We specifically study learning to predict whether choices tend to lead to good or bad outcomes.  We work closely with clinical collaborators, sometimes implementing tasks in animals that have shown differences between patients and controls, sometimes taking findings from the animal work to clinical populations.  As we develop a better understanding of how these brain systems drive learning, we can develop a better understanding of how pathology in these systems can underlie various psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression and behavioral addictions.  Recent work has focused on broadening our understanding of the network of areas important for these learning processes.  Current conceptions of the circuitry that underlies this learning focuses on dopamine and the ventral-striatum, whereas our recent work also points to an important role for the amygdala.  Ongoing work examines whether different neural systems underlie learning from positive vs. negative outcomes (rewards vs. punishments) and whether overlapping or distinct neural systems underlie learning actions that are beneficial, vs. learning to choose objects that are beneficial.  We have recently found that the ventral-striatum plays a specific role in learning from rewards, when they are associated with objects.","addiction;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Area;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Clinical;Code;Conceptions;Corpus striatum structure;cost;Disease;Dopamine;dopamine system;dopaminergic neuron;experience;Feeling;Goals;Image;Lead;Learning;Life;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Modeling;neurophysiology;Outcome;outcome prediction;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Pharmacology;Play;Population;Prevalence;Process;programs;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Punishment;relating to nervous system;Research;Rewards;Role;Signal Transduction;Societies;Students;System;teacher;Time;Trauma;Update;Ventral Striatum;Work;","FRONTAL STRIATAL SYSTEMS AND DOPAMINE IN NORMAL AND PATHOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR",n/a,"NIMH","9568277","","",1ZIAMH002928-08,1,ZIA,MH,002928,08,,Unavailable,"","","",,"10687538","AVERBECK, BRUNO ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1863202,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Neurosciences","The primary goals of this research are i) to establish how learning impacts the structure and function of the brain, and ii) to determine how learning can be modulated by factors such as feedback (positive or negative). Over the past year we have focused equally on both of these goals.1) Impact of learning on brain structure and function (NCT00001360)Over the past few years, we have been conducting a long-term longitudinal study of participants learning different tasks (e.g. motor sequences, spatial layout) to determine how structural properties of the brain (gray matter, white matter) change over time. Over a period of four weeks, participants were trained in two different tasks and we collected extensive functional and structural MRI data over the course of training. While previous studies have identified structural changes associated with learning, even over the course of a couple of hours, our initial findings have highlighted a potential confound that needs to be accounted for in such studies. Specifically, we have found that the structural measures obtained with MRI fluctuate according to the time of day, with decreases in gray matter thickness and increases in ventricular volume. These fluctuations appear to be related to changes in cerebrospinal fluid in the brain and may reflect the impact of the daily circadian rhythm.Interestingly, these fluctuation appear to be modulated by training and we are trying to establish what additional structural and functional changes occur with training above and beyond these time-of-day effects. With the motor sequence task we find that, following training, sensorimotor networks show changes in their functional connectivity. In contrast, with the spatial layout task, hippocampal networks change. These findings suggest task-specific changes in particular networks underlie learning above and beyond any changes due to circadian fluctuations.2) Impact of feedback on learning (NCT00001360)We are investigating the impact of feedback (positive, negative) on motor learning. Groups of participants were trained on one of two different motor tasks and either provided with positive, negative or neutral (uninformative) feedback. Training occurred in the MRI scanner and we measured fMRI activity before, during and after training. Behaviorally, we found that the impact of feedback is dependent on the task. While in a sequence learning task we find that punishment improves online performance, we observe the opposite effect in a purely motoric force-tracking task.In terms of brain activity, we found that punishment was more associated with changes in the medial temporal lobe and hippocampus, while reward was more associated with changes in the cerebellum. These findings suggest a dissociation of the neural mechanisms underlying the impact of reward and punishment that might be utilized to enhance training.Establishing the nature, degree and consequences of plasticity in the adult cortex provides important insights into the potential for rehabilitative brain therapies following injury or dysfunction in the nervous system.","Adult;behavior measurement;Behavioral;Brain;Cerebellum;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Circadian Rhythms;Data;Development;Dissociation;Feedback;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;gray matter;Hippocampus (Brain);Hour;Human;improved;Injury;insight;Learning;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Medial;Motor;motor learning;Nature;Nervous system structure;neuromechanism;Participant;Performance;Property;Punishment;Rehabilitation therapy;relating to nervous system;Research;Rewards;sequence learning;skills;Structure;Temporal Lobe;Thick;Time;Training;Ventricular;white matter;white matter change;","LEARNING AND PLASTICITY IN THE HUMAN BRAIN",n/a,"NIMH","9568270","","",1ZIAMH002893-11,1,ZIA,MH,002893,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9694559","BAKER, CHRISTOPHER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,330249,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Clinical Research;Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Mental Health;Neurosciences","The goal of this research is to understand how we see what we see: how does the brain analyze the light falling on the retina of the eye to reveal a world full of objects, people and things? During the past year we have focused on the perception of complex visual stimuli, in particular real-world visual scenes (NCT00001360).Perception of real world scenes: Real-world scenes are incredibly complex and heterogeneous, yet we are able to identify and categorize them effortlessly. While prior studies have identified three major brain regions that appear to be specialized for scene processing, it remains unclear what the precise roles of these different regions are and what information they contain. Building on a general framework for visual processing we proposed in the past few years, we have been investigating the basic properties of these three scene-selective regions and trying to elucidate how these three regions interact to enable us to understand the world before our eyes. In particular, we have been investigating the extent to which these regions can be explained in terms of encoding low level visual properties (e.g. contrast, color, edges) versus high level properties (e.g. objects, category, actions that can be performed in the depicted scene). One main area of focus has been the relationship between retinotopy (point-by-point mapping of the visual field onto the cortical surface of the brain) and category-selectivity (differential responses to images from different visual categories e.g. scenes versus faces). We evaluate retinotopy by presenting fragments of scenes to specific portions of the visual field and measure the response across the brain with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similarly, we measure category-selectivity by presenting images from different categories (e.g. faces, scenes, objects, bodies) and measuring the associated brain response. We find that there is no simple relationship between these two different organizational principles. Category-selective regions exhibit retinotopy, but individual category-selective regions overlap multiple maps. These results suggests that individual category-selective regions may contain multiple sub-regions within specific retinotopic maps that perform separate computations on the images. One of these scene-selective regions is found in medial parietal cortex and is often implicated in memory function and spatial navigation. Our data show that there may be a gradient of function within medial parietal cortex. Posterior regions show strong retinotopy and scene-selectivity and are most strongly connected with other regions of posterior visual cortex. In contrast anterior regions are much less retinotopic and scene-selective but show strong connectivity with regions of ventral temporal cortex and parietal cortex that are implicated in memory.In addition to studying how the representations of scenes are spatially distributed within the brain, we have also been examining the time course of visual scene processing using electroencephalography (EEG). In contrast to fMRI, which has good spatial but poor temporal resolution, EEG allows us to monitor brain activity at a millisecond resolution. These experiments have revealed that scene-selective activity and representation of specific scene properties such as naturalness, is not observed until approximately 200 milliseconds after the onset of a scene picture, much later then the initial visual response.Collectively these results provide important insights into the brain network that is involved in processing real-world visual scenes and we have recently developed a specific framework for thinking about the distributed processing of scenes within visual cortex. We are currently evaluating the specific roles of scene-selective regions by i) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (or TMS) to temporarily disrupt their function and observe the impact on behavior; ii) comparing explicit computational and theoretical models of scene representation with the representations observed in different parts of the brain.Elucidating how the brain enables us to recognize objects, scenes, faces and bodies provides important insights into the nature of our internal representations of the world around us. Understanding these representations is vital in trying to determine the underlying deficits in many mental health and neurological disorders.","Anterior;Area;Behavior;behavior measurement;Body measure procedure;Body part;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Categories;Color;Complex;Computer Simulation;Data;Electroencephalography;Exhibits;experience;experimental study;Eye;Face;falls;foot;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Hand;Human;Image;Individual;insight;interest;Knowledge;Learning;Leg;Light;Maps;Measures;Medial;Memory;Mental Health;millisecond;Monitor;Nature;nervous system disorder;Parietal Lobe;Participant;Perception;Property;Research;Resolution;response;Retina;retinotopic;Role;Social Behavior;Stimulus;Surface;Temporal Lobe;temporal measurement;Theoretical model;Thinking;Time;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Visual;Visual Cortex;Visual Fields;visual processing;visual stimulus;way finding;","OBJECT; FACE;  BODY AND SCENE REPRESENTATIONS IN THE HUMAN BRAIN",n/a,"NIMH","9568274","","",1ZIAMH002909-10,1,ZIA,MH,002909,10,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9694559","BAKER, CHRISTOPHER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1320995,
"Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Biotechnology;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Protocol number 93-M-0170, NCT00001360The Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM) has advanced functional MRI (fMRI) methodology through development of processing and acquisition methods as well as research on the underlying mechanisms behind the fMRI signal. Our work over the past year has focused on methods to extract more information related to tasks, mental state, and individual traits from the fMRI time series. At high resolution we have more accurately mapped cortical layer connectivity and activity. Due to limited space, we decided to highlight here a few projects that are representative of our ongoing work. Multi-Echo Applications Our group has been pioneering the development and use of Multi-echo fMRI (ME fMRI). Because blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and non-BOLD signal fluctuations behave differently as a function of echo time, the unique ME fMRI acquisition of at least one echo allows for efficient and robust detection and removal of non-BOLD fluctuations from the time series. Our work developing and utilizing ME fMRI continues. In collaboration with Dr. Caballero-Gaudes, we are working on the detection of individual BOLD events with no information about the task timing or location. Preliminary tests show that the algorithm can reliably detect BOLD events associated with each individual trial in a manner similar to traditional GLM methods, yet without any information on paradigm timing. This new method has important applications including: uncovering hemodynamic events driving dynamic resting functional connectivity, and detecting inter-ictal events in epilepsy patients without the need for concurrent EEG recordings.  Dynamic Functional Connectivity Dynamic functional connectivity (FC), understood as patterns of functional brain connectivity that change at the scale of seconds to minutes, has gained great attention in recent years. FC configurations can differ significantly from those obtained from entire time series, and recent studies suggest there is a link between these dynamics and individual behavior and behavioral traits. We previously demonstrated how whole-brain short-term FC patterns could be used to identify cognitive tasks. We are currently investigating how these patterns may provide useful behaviorally-relevant information about individual subjects  to be used as a biomarker for specific traits. We are also investigating elements that drive these dynamics and differences in dynamics  ranging from changes in arousal and engagement to changes in attention.  Lastly, we are exploring the degree to which dynamics of specific networks can predict behavior. Towards the goal of deriving specific individual traits from FC network strengths, we had subjects perform a 2-back task, look for a visual target in a movie, and solve math problems. Performance was recorded on each task. Surprisingly, the sustained attention network (previously found) provided better prediction of performance than the 2-back-specific network. fMRI Connectivity vs. fMRI Magnitude Changes Our work on task-based connectivity change assessment has opened up an entirely new vista in fMRI processing. We have revealed that, for cognitive tasks, task based connectivity changes are more spatially extensive than magnitude changes and more specific or sensitive for a given task. This observation potentially opens a new subfield of brain mapping  where connectivity changes are mapped rather than magnitude changes. We are actively exploring the robustness, repeatability, and task specificity of these observations. Naturalistic TasksTraditional task-based fMRI experiments use tightly controlled paradigms that often lack ecological validity. Resting-state scans, on the other hand, are unconstrained, making it difficult to separate signal from noise. Naturalistic tasks, in which subjects view a movie or listen to a story in the scanner, may provide a happy medium for studying both group-level functional brain organization and individual differences. By imposing a standardized, time-stamped, and engaging stimulus on all subjects, naturalistic tasks evoke rich patterns of brain activity. These patterns lend themselves to flexible, data-driven analyses such as inter-subject correlation (ISC) and inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC), which are model-free ways to isolate stimulus-dependent brain activity from spontaneous activity and noise. These techniques have several advantages over traditional approaches: 1) they do not requirea priorimodeling of specific task events and/or assumptions about the functional specificity of individual brain regions; 2) there is no need to assume a fixed hemodynamic response function; and 3) they allow for the characterization of the full spatiotemporal richness of both evoked and intrinsic brain activity. In our work, we hypothesize that individual differences in psychological traits - namely suspicion and paranoia - are able to be differentiated by observation of brain activity elicited by a naturalistic task involving a narrative describing a complex social scenario that was deliberately ambiguous regarding characters trustworthiness and intentions. The intent was that some subjects would interpret the story as more suspicious, and others as less so. The narrative did evoke a range of interpretations. We collected data from 23 healthy subjects as they listened to the pre-recorded narrative during fMRI scanning, and characterized their feelings and beliefs about the narrative. We found that pairs of subjects with more similar activity fluctuations in primary visual and visual association cortices--suggesting that they were engaging in more similar mental imagery during listening--were more likely to speak about the story in similar ways afterward. One ultimate goal of this line of work is to develop a neuroimaging-based stress test for use in both clinical and subclinical populations. Such a test would draw out individual differences beyond what can be observed at rest or using more traditional tasks, potentially leading to earlier identification of subjects at risk for mental illness or helping to guide interventions.Continuation of mapping layer-specific brain activity at 7TIn the last year, we continued to develop acquisition fMRI methods that can measure brain activity with ultra-high resolution, aiming to distinguish activity across cortical layers. The novel parameter space explored since October 2016 includes: a. The necessity of physiological noise correction with sub-millimeter voxels where thermal noise dominates. b. The capabilities of layer-fMRI at ultra-high field strengths of 9.4T compared to 7T. c. The layer-dependent signal features across different cortical columns in M1 in a participant-specific surface-based signal evaluation scheme. d.

"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Protocol number 93-M-0170, NCT00001360Space Utilization:The Functional MRI Facility (FMRIF) currently occupies approximately 4800 sq. ft of space, divided between the scanner bays, control rooms and electronics/machine rooms for 3TA, 3TB, 3TC, 3TD, and 7T MRI scanners located within the NMR center and office space on the second floor above the NMR center in the FMRIF/SFIM suite (approximately 1400 sq ft total, including shared conference space).The FMRIF staff (currently 14 full- time positions) consists of: the facility director, four staff scientists to keep the scanners running, six MRI technologists, an information technology specialist, a programmer, and an administrative laboratory manger.The functional MRI facility supports the research of over 30 Principal Investigators translating to over 300 researchers overall. Over 70 research protocols are active and making use of FMRIF scanners. Each scanner has scheduled operating hours of 105 hours per week.Since its inception in 2000 until August 2017, a total of 1,126 peer-reviewed publications from intramural investigators have used data acquired in the FMRIF core facility. The total is distributed among 747 papers from NIMH, 280 papers from NINDS, and 99 from the other institutes. These papers have been cited a total of 106,561 times for a combined h-index of 161. In other words, 161 papers using the FMRIF have been cited at least 161 times.'Projects: Projects: Staff Scientists working on projects are designated as: Sean Marrett (SM), Vinai Roopchansingh (VR), Andy Derbyshire (AD), and Linquing Li (LL). The goals of these projects are aimed to increase the overall utility of the fMRI core facility for the most possible users.Upgrade 3TA/B: SM and VR managed contracting, planning, design, construction and final equipping of upgraded 3TA/3TB suite and systems from HDx to mr750 platform including access to better chilled water.

There are upcoming potential collaboration using this capability, both from NHGRI (Philip Shaw) and NIAAA (Reza Momenan).Gadgetron: VR has continued his involvement with the ISMRMRD and Gadgetron projects. Over the last year, he has openly made available (in a public GitHub repository) a template ISMRMRD converter that converts data from General Electric scanners into the ISMRMRD format. He will continue his involvement to leverage the advantage the Gadgetron and ISMRMRD hold for the plethora of platforms the FMRIF currently supports.Blood nulling implementation: LL is working on implementing a method by which intravascular spins travelling at velocities above 2-3 mm/sec are nulled. The sequence that performs this nulling is called a DANTE-EPI sequence. The goal is to increase localization of fMRI by eliminating downstream vessels.Dynamic Phase Correction: AD has implemented dynamic phase correction for multi-echo EPI.EPI-based T1 mapping: AD has developed a variable flip-angle multi-echo EPI sequence to simultaneously measure the BOLD signal and the T1 map using multi-echo EPI-based fMRI sequence.

"Autism;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Fragile X Syndrome;Genetics;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD);Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Rare Diseases;Sleep Research;Tuberous Sclerosis","The protocol involved in this project is 06-M-0214, NCT00362843.During the 2017 funding period, we addressed the following: 1) rCPS measured with the L-1-C-11leucine PET method in patients with FXS and healthy volunteers studied either under dexmedetomidine sedation or in the awake state, 2) Effects of treatment with metformin on rCPS and behavior in Fmr1 KO mice, 3) Effects of treatment with an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE-4D) on behavior and rCPS in Fmr1 KO mice, 4) rCPS in Tsc2+/- mice, 5) Sleep abnormalities in Fmr1 KO and Tsc2+/- mice.1) Fragile X syndrome. We continue to analyze results of our studies of rCPS in patients with FXS  measured with the L-1-C-11leucine PET. In studies of patients and healthy controls studied under sedation we did not find increased rCPS in the patient population.  As with our previous studies of FXS subjects under propofol sedation, rCPS in dexmedetomidine-sedated subjects are lower compared with age-matched controls.  Currently, we are focusing on studies of awake patients and healthy controls studied with a modified protocol. Our hypothesis is that rCPS is altered in patients with FXS compared with age-matched controls. These studies are ongoing. 2) Metformin treatment of Fmr1 KO mice. T. Jongens (University of Pennsylvania) reported recently that elevated insulin signaling is involved in the expression of behavioral phenotypes in the Drosophila model of FXS (dfmr1). We are following up this finding by testing the efficacy of metformin on rCPS and behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Metformin is a biguanide drug used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Mice are treated chronically as adults and tested on tests of memory and rCPS are measured.   The results of these studies are being analyzed.3) Treatment of Fmr1 KO mice with an inhibitor of PDE-4D. Work from Berry-Kravis (Rush College of Medicine) indicates that cAMP is reduced in peripheral cells from patients with FXS and that in neuroblastoma cells cAMP production is regulated by FMRP. Moreover, work from the laboratory of T. Jongens shows that inhibition of PDE-4 ameliorates memory deficits in the dfmr1 fly and restores mGluR-dependent LTD to WT levels in the Fmr1 KO mouse. In collaboration with Tetra Discovery Partners, we are testing the efficacy of a negative allosteric modulator (NAM) of PDE-4D (BPN-14770). We are chronically treating Fmr1 KO mice with the PDE-4D NAM and measuring its effects on behavior and rCPS.  These studies are ongoing.4) Another syndromic form of autism under study in the SNPM is tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is an autosomal dominant neurogenetic disorder manifested by a high incidence of seizures, intellectual disability, and autism. TSC is caused by mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2, which encode for proteins that form a complex and interact with a small GTP-binding protein, RHEB, to inhibit mTORC1. mTORC1 is a central regulator of ribosomal biogenesis and translation initiation, and loss of TSC1/2 function results in increased activity of mTORC1. We hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of TSC2 (Tsc2+/-) in mice would lead to increased rCPS. To date, our in vivo measurements of rCPS in freely-moving awake, adult, male Tsc2+/- mice indicate that rCPS is decreased in selective brain regions. Current experiments are addressing the effects of the mutation in TSC2 on recycling of leucine derived from protein degradation in the tissue; this is a critical factor in the equation for rCPS.   These studies are ongoing.5) Sleep and neurodevelopmental disorders. Sleep abnormalities are one of the most prevalent concurrent disorders in patients diagnosed with neurodevelopmental syndromes. In these patients, the severity of behavioral abnormalities and the severity of sleep abnormalities are correlated. Given the importance of sleep in developmental plasticity, we sought to examine sleep behavior in two animal models of single gene neurodevelopmental disorders, FXS and TSC. We used home cage monitoring to investigate total sleep times during the light and dark phases. We found that Fmr1 KO mice at two and six months of age sleep less than WT mice in the light phase.  In younger animals (at p21), we found no difference between Fmr1 KO and WT mice in sleep times.  Sleep deficits were not restored by treatment with a GABA-B agonist, R-baclofen.  The results of these studies are in press (Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience) Future studies will address the ability of other drugs to improve sleep and improve behavioral phenotypes.  Future studies will also address sleep in other single gene neurodevelopmental disorders.","Address;Adult;Age;Age-Months;Agonist;Animal Model;Animals;autistic behaviour;Autistic Disorder;awake;Baclofen;base;Behavior;Behavioral;Berry;Biguanides;Biogenesis;Blood flow;Brain;Brain region;Cells;Cerebrum;CGG repeat;Chronic;Collaborations;college;Complex;Controlled Study;Cyclic AMP;Darkness;Data;Defect;Dendritic Spines;Development;developmental disease;developmental plasticity;Dexmedetomidine;dFMR1 gene;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Marker;Drosophila genus;Drug usage;efficacy testing;Ensure;Equation;experimental study;Face;fly;FMR1;Fragile X Premutation;Fragile X Syndrome;Frequencies;frontier;Funding;Future;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Generations;Genes;GTP-Binding Proteins;healthy volunteer;Hippocampus (Brain);Home environment;human subject;Hyperactive behavior;Hypothalamic structure;improved;in vivo;Incidence;Individual;Inherited;inhibitor/antagonist;insulin signaling;Intellectual functioning disability;juvenile animal;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Laboratories;Lead;Length;Leucine;Light;Link;male;man;Measurement;Measures;Medicine;Memory;Memory impairment;Mental Retardation;Metformin;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;mouse model;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Nervous system structure;neuroblastoma cell;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;neurogenetics;Neurosciences;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;patient population;Patients;Pennsylvania;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phenotype;phosphodiesterase 4D;Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors;Positron-Emission Tomography;Procedures;Production;Propofol;Protein Biosynthesis;protein degradation;protein metabolism;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Recycling;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Ribosomes;Role;Sedation procedure;sedative;Seizures;Sensory;Severities;Sleep;sleep abnormalities;Sleep Disorders;Study Subject;Synapses;synaptic function;Synaptic plasticity;Syndrome;Testing;Testis;Thalamic structure;Time;Tissues;tool;Translation Initiation;Translations;treatment effect;Treatment Efficacy;TSC1 gene;TSC1/2 gene;TSC2 gene;Tuberous sclerosis protein complex;Universities;Wild Type Mouse;Work;X Chromosome;","DYSREGULATION OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IN FRAGILE X SYNDROME AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9568239","","",1ZIAMH000889-38,1,ZIA,MH,000889,38,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15226809","BEEBE, CAROLYN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1398670,
"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Neurosciences","In the current year we have refined our data analysis methods for estimation of rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) with L-1-C-11leucine and PET. Effects on rCPS with changes in physiological and even pathological states are expected to be modest, so  it is essential that the analyses achieve the highest possible accuracy. We also examined the impact of simplifying patient scanning protocols on estimation of rCPS.(1) Refinement of kinetic model analysis methods. Quantification with PET tracers utilizes compartmental models that generally assume homogeneity for each tissue region-of-interest (ROI) with respect to relevant physiological variables. The kinetic model of the C-11leucine PET method was originally applied to ROI data with the assumption that each ROI is homogeneous with respect to concentrations of amino acids, blood flow, transport and metabolism of amino acids, and rCPS. Due to the limited spatial resolution of PET, however, most regions contain a kinetically heterogeneous mixture of tissue components; this may bias estimation results. We have been refining our analyses to minimize effects of tissue heterogeneity on estimates of kinetic parameters and rCPS. We reasoned that a substantial reduction in the volume of a tissue region should reduce the impact of heterogeneity. We developed a method to apply the homogeneous tissue model to analysis of PET data at the voxel level, the Basis Function Method (BFM). We found that voxel-level BFM estimates of rCPS averaged over a ROI were substantially less biased than estimates based on direct fitting of the ROI time-activity curve (TAC) with a homogeneous tissue model. Model fits of the TACs showed that effects of tissue heterogeneity had been reduced, but not eliminated. We developed a second approach that explicitly takes heterogeneity within a ROI into account, spectral analysis with an iterative filter (SAIF). When applied to ROI-level data, SAIF-ROI produced low bias, low variance estimates of rCPS. It performed comparably to the voxel-level BFM method when count rates are normal, but at low count rates it performed better. Although SAIF allows for heterogeneity in a ROI, it does require an assumed constraint on the relationship among the kinetic parameters within the heterogeneous tissues. This has the most impact when kinetics of the various tissues within the ROI are most dissimilar. Under the premise that the dissimilarity among the tissues would be less at the voxel level, we extended the SAIF method for analysis of voxel-level data. In normal count rate studies, rCPS estimated with SAIF-voxel was approximately 5-15% higher than with SAIF-ROI analysis; inter-subject variability was comparable. Based on simulation studies we conclude that the difference is predominantly due to underestimation of rCPS with SAIF-ROI, i.e., the performance SAIF-voxel is better. As a final step, we investigated which data analysis method is optimal under various PET scanning conditions. When scanning with the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT), we found that voxel-level BFM and voxel-level SAIF analyses yielded comparable estimates of rCPS at count rates typical of our studies, but when the injected dose of leucine is unusually low, as when an unavoidable delay in injection occurs, low count rates lead to more biased voxel-level BFM estimates of rCPS.  When scanner resolution is lower, however, voxel-level SAIF performs better irrespective of injected dose. We conclude that studies on the high resolution PET scanner, with standard injected doses of C-11leucine, can be analyzed with the computationally simpler voxel-level BFM.  (2) Simplification of scanning protocols. One of our goals is to be able to study subjects with intellectual disabilities without the need for sedation, so any changes in the procedure that make the study less onerous for subjects may help us to achieve that goal. The C-11leucine method was originally validated with a protocol that requires arterial blood sampling and a 90 min scan time. (a) We have expanded our investigation of the effects of shortening the scan duration.  We have reanalyzed thirty-nine scans in three groups of subjects with the voxel-level Basis Function Method (BFM) that is based on a homogeneous tissue model.  These scans were acquired on the high resolution scanner and subjects were administered doses of C-11leucine that resulted good counting statistics.  In these groups we  found that rCPS values estimated on a 60 min estimation interval were almost identical to those estimated with the full 90 minutes of acquired data. Furthermore, statistical comparisons of the groups yielded the same results on the 60 and 90 min estimation intervals.  We have expanded the study to examine effects of utilizing a heterogeneous tissue model for situations where this is a better analysis method (see Part 1 above).  We have reanalzed data from scans of five healthy control subjects with voxel-level Spectral Analysis Iterative Filter (SIAF) method that allows for heterogeneity in the tissue.  Values of rCPS were estimated on intervals beginning at the time of tracer injection and ending 30, 45, 60, 75, or 90 min later.  On the 30 min interval SAIF failed to converge to a solution in the majority of voxels, and on the 45 min interval only 67% of voxels converged.  On intervals 60 min and longer more than 95% of voxels converged.  There was a small decrease in rCPS between the 60 and 90 min intervals; the mean relative difference was 6  5% in whole brain.  This suggests that the scanning interval can be reduced to 60 min when SAIF is used in the analysis, but further investigation is warranted.  (b) We examined the effects of substituting venous for arterial blood sampling. We use a population-derived arterial input function scaled by the subjects' own measured venous data. Analyses of 22 scans of three groups of subjects support the feasibility of utilizing venous in place of arterial blood sampling. We compared rCPS values determined with measured arterial blood data with rCPS based on venous-rescaled population input functions; we found no statistically significant differences in rCPS in either whole brain or any of the 16 regions examined in any group.   We have further developed an input function that is based on arterial blood activity measured in a region of interest drawn on the carotid artery in the PET image. The PET image-derived input function establishes bounds on the time course of the arterial blood activity; it provides additional validation for the use of the venous-rescaled population input function.Based on these findings, we conclude that the simplified scanning protocol for the C-11leucine PET method, i.e., a scan time of 60 minutes and use of the venous-rescaled population input function, can be used in C-11leucine studies on the high resolution research tomograph without compromising accuracy of rCPS measurements.","Address;amino acid metabolism;Amino Acids;base;Biochemical Process;Biochemical Reaction;Blood;Blood flow;Blood specimen;Brain;Brain imaging;Carotid Arteries;Cerebrum;comparison group;Data;Data Analyses;Disease;Dose;Functional Imaging;Goals;Heterogeneity;Image;imaging modality;imaging study;in vivo imaging;Injectable;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intellectual functioning disability;interest;Investigation;Kinetics;Lead;Leucine;mathematical analysis;mathematical model;Mathematics;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic Pathway;Methods;Modeling;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Performance;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Procedures;Protein Biosynthesis;Protocols documentation;Radioactive Tracers;Research;Resolution;Scanning;Sedation procedure;simulation;Statistical Data Interpretation;statistics;Study Subject;Techniques;Testing;Time;Tissue Model;Tissues;Tracer;Validation;Venous;Work;","MATHEMATICAL AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES FOR IN VIVO IMAGING STUDIES",n/a,"NIMH","9568279","","",1ZIAMH002935-06,1,ZIA,MH,002935,06,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15226809","BEEBE, CAROLYN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,236139,

Picchioni), we applied the L-1-C-11leucine PET method to measure rCPS in human subjects during sleep. To address the restoration hypothesis of sleep, we measure rCPS in the same subject during normal wakefulness, sleep-deprived wakefulness, and sleep. We hypothesize that rCPS is increased during sleep, but that during sleep-deprived wakefulness, rCPS remain at levels comparable to rested wakefulness. Subjects undergo the initial scan in the awake, sleep-sated state. Subjects are then kept awake over the next 30 h and subsequently undergo a second PET scan in the sleep-deprived but awake state. Subjects are then encouraged to sleep in the scanner while they undergo a third scan during slow wave sleep. Subjects are healthy male and female volunteers between the ages of 18 and 28 y. We exclude subjects with a history of neurological and psychiatric disorders, chronic medical conditions, and sleep disorders. Our preliminary results indicate no differences in rCPS during slow wave sleep.To address the role of protein synthesis in memory consolidation, we are determining whether sleep-dependent increases in rCPS are associated with sleep-dependent improvements in memory. We use the Texture Discrimination Task (TDT) to assess learning and memory. Improvement on performance of this task has been demonstrated to depend on sleep. The TDT is retinotopically specific, so training in one hemisphere (due to stimuli in the contralateral visual field) does not improve performance in the opposite hemisphere. This allows us to determine changes in rCPS in the trained hemisphere of the primary visual cortex and use the untrained hemisphere as a control. The task is administered at 8 AM, subjects are randomized to nap (12:30-2 PM) or awake groups, and the task is re-administered at 6 PM. The stimulus of the TDT is always in the lower half of the visual field and we randomize the stimulated side (left or right). From 12:30-2 PM (awake or nap opportunity), subjects undergo simultaneous L-1-11Cleucine PET and electroencephalography (EEG). We hypothesize that an increase in rCPS in the trained hemisphere will be observed in subjects who spent a significant time in slow wave sleep during the nap opportunity. We further hypothesize that this increase will correlate with the improvement in performance between the two administrations of the task.","Address;Age;Animals;area striata;Autistic Disorder;awake;base;Brain;Cerebrum;Chronic;Collaborations;Contralateral;Discrimination;Electroencephalography;Elements;executive function;Female;Funding;Goals;Hormonal;Human;human subject;Learning;Left;male;Measures;Medical;Memory;memory consolidation;Mental disorders;Methods;Napping;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;nervous system disorder;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Performance;Positron-Emission Tomography;prevent;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Synthesis Inhibition;Protocols documentation;psychologic;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Research Institute;Rest;restoration;retinotopic;Role;Scanning;Side;Sleep;Sleep Deprivation;Sleep Disorders;Slow-Wave Sleep;Stimulus;Task Performances;Testing;Texture;Time;Training;Visual Fields;volunteer;Wakefulness;","CEREBRAL PROTEIN SYNTHESIS DURING SLEEP AND MEMORY CONSOLIDATION",n/a,"NIMH","9568280","","",1ZIAMH002936-06,1,ZIA,MH,002936,06,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15226809","BEEBE, CAROLYN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,90823,

"Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Cerebrovascular;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities;Genetics;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Precision Medicine;Schizophrenia;Serious Mental Illness","The core aim of this project is to elucidate the nature, molecular foundations, underlying neurochemistry, and clinical correlates of neural systems-level dysfunction in schizophrenia. Toward that end, this year, the Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch has successfully executed comprehensive, multimodal positron emission tomography- and magnetic resonance imaging-based studies of a unique and steadily growing cohort of individuals with schizophrenia who have agreed to be studied under placebo (medication-free) conditions in comparison to matched healthy individuals. Though this work is necessarily challenging to conduct, we continue to make progress in data collection, which includes characterization of dopamine-dependent mnemonic and reward-related neural responses, striatal presynaptic dopamine synthetic capacity, and both D1 and D2/3 receptor availability, as well as prefrontal measurements of GABA and glutamate concentrations. In order to develop precision, personalized clinical care in the treatment of schizophrenia, greater neurobiological understanding is needed of the high variability across individuals in medication response. Over the past year, in efforts to address this knowledge gap, we have focused our work on identifying not only important alterations in neural systems that accompany schizophrenia in the absence of medication, but also the neurochemical predictors of neuroleptic-driven changes in brain activity and symptom burden.  For example, in work focused on subcortical neural systems in schizophrenia, we have employed positron emission tomography methods to understand the functional and neurochemical consequences of antipsychotic treatment.  In the dopamine receptor-rich striatum, where some individuals with schizophrenia or genetic risk factors for schizophrenia demonstrate increased dopamine synthesis capacity, resting neural activity in patients may change with neuroleptic treatment; however, whether this may be relevant to medication response and whether dopamine system characteristics underlie variance in medication-induced striatal activity changes is not established. Therefore, we studied inpatients who underwent several weeks of blinded medication withdrawal to determine PET-measured striatal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity. Striatal rCBF was markedly higher during antipsychotic therapy relative to placebo. Integrating these findings in the brain with our recent work on constructing an approach to psychopathology measurement using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), we found that medication-related increases in ventral striatal rCBF were associated with more robust amelioration of excitement symptoms during active medication. Furthermore, in the ventral striatum, rCBF increases were also predicted by greater dopamine synthesis capacity during placebo treatment. These data indicate that atypical medications enact measurable physiological alterations in limbic striatal circuitry, that these alterations vary as a function of dopaminergic tone, and that they may be relevant to aspects of therapeutic response.In longitudinal studies utilizing MRS to assay GABA concentrations in the frontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia undergoing blinded medication-free periods, we found no GABA level differences when antipsychotic and placebo treatment conditions were compared. Though not establishing MRS-derived GABA levels as a robust biomarker in regard to treatment response, this negative finding serves as an important point of reference for the schizophrenia spectroscopy literature and for further neurochemical study.Finally, analyses are underway for two completed personalized-medicine drug trials examining interactions between genotype for COMT, an enzyme important for maintaining cortical dopamine, and effects of dopamine-modulating medication on cognitive function in schizophrenia. Results from these integrative, multimodal, pharmacogenetic clinical data will inform models of dopamine-linked cognitive dysfunction and remediation.This work involves the following studies: NCT00942981, NCT00001258, NCT00024622, NCT00004571, NCT00001247,NCT00001486, NCT00044083, NCT00057707","Address;Affect;Antipsychotic Agents;base;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blinded;Brain;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Characteristics;Clinical;clinical care;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cognition;cognitive function;Cognitive remediation;cohort;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Databases;Development;developmental genetics;Disease;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;dopamine system;dopaminergic neuron;drug withdrawal;Enzymes;Executive Dysfunction;Foundations;frontal lobe;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;gene discovery;genetic risk factor;Genotype;Glutamates;Image;imaging modality;Impaired cognition;in vivo;indexing;Individual;Inpatients;Intramural Research Program;Knowledge;Link;Literature;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Measurable;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Modafinil;Modeling;Molecular;multimodality;National Institute of Mental Health;Nature;Negative Finding;neural circuit;neural correlate;Neurobiology;neurochemistry;neuroimaging;neuropsychiatric disorder;neuropsychiatry;Neurotransmitters;Noise;novel;Parkinson Disease;Patients;personalized medicine;personalized therapeutic;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacogenetics;Phenotype;Physiological;Placebos;Play;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prefrontal Cortex;presynaptic;Procedures;programs;Protocols documentation;Psychopathology;radioligand;receptor;Regulation;relating to nervous system;Research;research facility;response;Rest;Rewards;risk variant;Role;Schizophrenia;Signal Transduction;Spectrum Analysis;Subgroup;Susceptibility Gene;Symptoms;Synapses;Syndrome;System;targeted agent;Testing;theories;tolcapone;translational neuroscience;treatment response;Ventral Striatum;ward;Withdrawal;Work;","IMAGING OF NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL AND GENETIC MECHANISMS",n/a,"NIMH","9589751","","",1ZIAMH002652-25,1,ZIA,MH,002652,25,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8469065","BERMAN, KAREN FAITH",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,800735,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Depression;Estrogen;Genetics;Human Genome;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Serious Mental Illness","The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to make advances on several fronts in order to delineate the neurochemical, neurogenetic, and neuropsychological contributions to neural systems function and development relevant to mental illness. We have embarked on data collection for two unprecedented scientific resources: first, a unique multimodal neuroimaging dataset in adults that includes neuropsychological testing, extensive dopaminergic PET imaging as well as functional and structural MRI; and, second, a longitudinal, neurodevelopmental dataset that incorporates structural and functional magnetic resonance-based brain imaging, neuropsychological measures, and, in conjunction with the Section on Behavioral Endocrinology, precise, state-of-the-art endocrinological measurements of pubertal status. These comprehensive ongoing data acquisition efforts have resulted in a growing repository of integrated, multimodal information about the brain, which will permit both novel analyses synthesizing disparate but interrelated indices of neurochemical (e.g., dopamine, GABA, and glutamate) functioning and discovery of critical genetic and endocrinological factors guiding neurodevelopment. Further progress this year has been multifactorial, with particular accomplishments in the area of neuroimaging genetics, in which an array of creative strategies, including genome-wide and targeted single SNP approaches, has been employed to discern specific neurogenetic mechanisms relevant to psychiatric illness.For instance, in a large cohort of healthy individuals of European ancestry, we found that the cumulative amount of Neanderthal-derived genetic variants harbored by an individual predicts expected incremental differences in parietal and occipital bone shapes resembling those of known Neanderthal cranial remains. We also identified correlates of this Neanderthal genetic load in visual cortex and intraparietal sulcus gray- and white-matter volume, sulcal depth, and gyrification. This work suggests that Neanderthal DNA variation may be functional in modern humans and may be particularly relevant to molecular mechanisms underlying the structure and function of parietal locales that we and other groups have found to be of particular importance in select developmental and neurological disorders.Additionally, in a collaborative study with the Cognitive Genomics Consortium (COGENT), a genome-wide search for association with general cognitive function in 35,298 healthy individuals of European descent across 24 cohorts yielded two new highly significant cognition-linked loci, measured heritability of over 20% for general cognitive function, and identified polygenic correlations between cognitive performance and other phenotypes, including psychiatric disorders.  These data demonstrate the power of collaborative, data-driven genome-wide approaches but do not overshadow the invaluable nature of targeted, hypothesis-driven studies.For instance, in light of convergent effects of ovarian steroid hormones and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on brain function, we conducted PET and fMRI studies of working memory in healthy women undergoing a 6-month hormone manipulation protocol during three conditions: pharmacologically-induced ovarian suppression, ovarian suppression plus estradiol; and ovarian suppression plus progesterone. We found an ovarian hormone-by-BDNF interaction on working memory-related hippocampal function owing to differential hippocampal recruitment in Met carriers but only in the presence of estradiol.  These data are the first to suggest that human hippocampal function in Met carriers is particularly sensitive to ovarian steroids, similar to prior observations of BDNF-by-estrous cycle interactions observed in mice.  In so far as BDNF is an important modulator of constitutive stress responses, these data may ultimately prove relevant to anxiety-related phenotypes.  Indeed, in an independent cohort, we have used rCBF PET to identify BDNF-associated differences in relationships between rCBF and trait anxiety in limbic/paralimbic regions, including the hippocampal/parahippocampal region.Additionally, this year, productivity in the area of neuroimaging methods development, which is important in ensuring sensitivity of our assays and replicability of our and field-wide results, has taken the form of application of machine learning algorithms to artifact screening and quality assessment of neuroimaging data, tasks generally requiring operator visual inspection, as well as an innovative approach to improving signal-to-noise ratios in MRS data by correction for drift in the frequency offset of the measured region due to small changes in the scanner magnetic field and patient movement over time.","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Anxiety;Area;Base of the Brain;Behavior Disorders;Behavioral;biological adaptation to stress;Biological Assay;Brain;brain circuitry;Brain imaging;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Cephalic;Child;Clinical;Cognition;Cognition Disorders;Cognitive;cognitive function;cognitive performance;cohort;Collaborations;Comorbidity;Complex;course development;Data;data acquisition;Data Collection;Data Set;Development;developmental disease;DNA;Dopamine;Endocrinology;Ensure;Environmental Risk Factor;Epidemiology;Estradiol;Estrogens;Estrous Cycle;European;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;gene interaction;Genetic;Genetic Load;genetic variant;genome-wide;Genomics;Glutamates;Gray unit of radiation dose;Heritability;Hippocampus (Brain);Hormonal;Hormonal Change;Hormones;Human;imaging modality;imaging study;improved;indexing;Individual;innovation;insight;intraparietal sulcus;Investigation;Knowledge;Light;Link;Locales;longitudinal design;Machine Learning;magnetic field;Magnetic Resonance;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Mental disorders;method development;Modernization;Molecular;Morphologic artifacts;Movement;Multimodal Imaging;multimodality;Mus;Nature;nervous system disorder;Neurobiology;neurochemistry;neurodevelopment;neurogenetics;neuroimaging;neuropsychiatry;Neuropsychological Tests;Neuropsychology;Noise;novel;occipital bone;Onset of illness;operation;Ovarian;Ovarian Ablation;Ovarian hormone;Ovarian Steroid Hormone;Parietal;Parietal bone structure;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Positron-Emission Tomography;Postpartum Period;premenstrual dysphoric disorder;Productivity;Progesterone;Protocols documentation;Psychotic Disorders;Recruitment Activity;relating to nervous system;repository;Resources;Risk;screening;severe mental illness;Sex Characteristics;Shapes;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Steroids;Structure;System;Testing;Time;trait;Translating;translational neuroscience;Variant;Visual;Visual Cortex;white matter;Woman;Work;","NEUROIMAGING OF BRAIN CIRCUITS AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS IN NORMAL COGNITION",n/a,"NIMH","9589753","","",1ZIAMH002717-23,1,ZIA,MH,002717,23,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8469065","BERMAN, KAREN FAITH",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1601470,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Congenital Structural Anomalies;Genetics;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD);Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Rare Diseases","The Clinical and Translational Neuroscience Branch continues to work toward discovery of novel genetic contributions to brain structure, function, and clinically relevant behavior and cognition, through a series of ongoing multimodal neuroimaging studies of individuals with copy number variation in the 7q11.23 Williams Syndrome (WS) genomic region (hemizygous microdeletion of a contiguous segment of DNA at this locus). These studies have been responsible for seminal advances in elaborating the neural underpinnings of both visuospatial and socio-emotional aspects of the 7q11.23 phenotype. Via multiple neuroimaging techniques, including voxel- and surface-based cortical morphometry, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI, we have established that the visuospatial construction deficits in WS are linked to convergent intraparietal sulcus alterations. Specifically, in this brain region, we have shown that individuals with WS harbor disrupted neural integrity, altered activation during spatial judgments, gray matter volume and sulcal depth reductions, and associated neural fiber tract anomalies. Likewise, in pursuit of systems-level correlates of the hypersociability and non-social anxiety observed in WS, we have found decreased amygdala activation evoked by fearful face stimuli and conversely, increased amygdala response to non-social frightening stimuli, abnormalities that were linked to altered prefrontal regulation in structural equation models. We have also identified convergent alterations in anterior insula structure, function, and inter-regional connectivity, which predict the characteristic WS personality.  Efforts this year have focused on data collection of these same structural and functional measurements of visuospatial and socio-emotional systems integrity in a growing cohort of children with and without WS critical region copy number variation (i.e., individuals with one WS, two typically developing, or three Dup7 copies of affected genes in the WS critical region) as part of our longitudinal WS neurodevelopmental initiative. In proof-of-concept work aimed at establishing neurostructural gene-dosage effects, we have studied microanatomical measures and found increasing overall brain size with increasing copy number (Dup7>TD>WS), but decreasing relative cerebellar size (WS>TD>Dup7) with copy number of affected genes. Interestingly, both of these Dup7 phenotypes (larger brain size and relatively smaller cerebellum) have been described in the autism literature, particularly in boys, although these findings are not without controversy.  Following this work, we are undertaking similar gene-dosage analyses of more localized morphometry throughout the brain, as well as local gyrification index and resting-state whole-brain connectivity, the latter using a recently-developed connectome-wide association study approach as well as independent component and dual-regression analyses. In parallel, we continue to undertake studies of WS-associated DNA sequence variation in individuals without WS. This work has yielded remarkable interactions between genotype in the WS-associated GTF2I gene and a measure of trait neuroticism, harm avoidance, in predicting prefrontal response during an emotional face viewing task. Insofar as GTF2I sequence variation affects the neural correlates of anxiety-related behavior, this gene may be of particular relevance to the dichotomous social versus non-social anxiety phenotypes present in WS. To the extent that this finding was identified in individuals without WS, such work exemplifies the translational possibilities of WS-directed research in benefiting a broader scientific understanding of key neural processes in the human brain.Preliminary data from our WS developmental cohort has already demonstrated parietal hypofunction during visuospatial challenge and altered social network activation during processing of socially salient stimuli, consistent with the hypothesis that both visuospatial and social neurobiological differences in WS are rooted in early life.  This project seeks not only to expand knowledge of the WS-related brain systems in childhood, but also to identify developmental trajectory (throughout childhood) and gene dose-response characteristics of neural abnormalities underlying visuospatial and socio-emotional alterations in this syndrome using a longitudinal, repeated measures design. Though data accrual will require years of careful and concerted effort to complete, the potential for these studies to shed unprecedented light on genetic contributions to brain development is enormous.

"Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Genetics;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences;Prevention;Schizophrenia;Serious Mental Illness","In order to better understand how schizophrenia risk genetics operate at the cognitive and neural systems level, our recent work under this project has focused on (1) identifying novel phenotypes that either (a) distinguish both people with schizophrenia and unaffected family members from unrelated healthy individuals or (b) identify meaningful subgroups of individuals with schizophrenia, and (2) discovering associations between specific risk genes and schizophrenia-linked brain phenotypes. Ongoing studies in these areas permit better understanding of heritable, trait-related abnormalities in schizophrenia, of the underlying molecular biology responsible for such abnormalities, and of strategies for resolving some of the illness heterogeneity that makes biological research so challenging.With respect to identifying illness-related phenotypes, in the largest MRS study of its kind to date, we recently found that one measure of in vivo levels of GABA, a critical inhibitory neurotransmitter, in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was reduced in patients with schizophrenia and their unaffected siblings as compared to healthy volunteers, was moderately heritable, and was nominally associated with positive symptom ratings. This work follows hypotheses of GABAergic disruption in schizophrenia primarily founded on post-mortem brain tissue investigations, and is in contrast to an important negative finding in which we confirmed an absence of MRS measured glutamate levels in the same brain region. Efforts to elaborate on these observations and, in the case of GABA, determine underlying genetic mechanisms are ongoing.Another strategy for identifying-illness related phenotypes is to employ hypothesis- and data-driven parcellations of multidimensional data to generate meaningful subgroupings of clinical populations. For example, we completed analyses based on stable negative and distress symptom dimensions, identifying 'deficit', 'distress', and 'low symptom' subgroups with starkly different demographic, diagnostic, clinical, cognitive, and personality characteristics, as well as distinct working-memory related brain activation patterns. Other current subgrouping analyses examine cluster analysis-derived patterns of current vs. pre-diagnosis cognitive performance.  These subgrouping schemes are now being tested as phenotypes for further studies of clinical, brain and genetic differences, which may ultimately prove relevant in assessing treatment needs.In so doing, we have now expanded our portfolio of genetic discovery.  For example, by taking advantage of genome-wide typing, these cognitive trajectory subgroups in fact show quite distinct patterns of genetic association with two broad genetic indexes summarizing, respectively, the genetics of schizophrenia risk and of general cognitive performance. Thus, we found a convergence between stratification based on common cognitive measures and stratification based on schizophrenia and cognitive genetics. For most individuals in our schizophrenia cohort, summary scores indexing common genetic risk for the condition were predictive of cognitive impairment. Strikingly, for one subgroup, that risk was entirely decoupled from cognitive performance.  Future work is underway to further test the naturally following hypothesis that different patterns of genetic risk identify subgroups with distinct illness etiologies and accompanying different trajectories of cognitive development through adolescence.  These results provide a fascinating complement to recent targeted investigations of cognitive genetics, in which we provided evidence that a single genetic variant related to sodium channel biology affects gene expression, contributes to measured cognitive abilities in individuals with schizophrenia, unaffected family members, and healthy cohorts, and is tied both to prefrontal inefficiency during working memory and interregional functional correspondence within the frontal cortex during rest.","Adolescence;Affect;Anterior;Area;Autopsy;base;Behavioral;Biological;biological research;Biology;Brain;brain behavior;Brain region;brain tissue;Characteristics;cingulate cortex;Clinical;Cluster Analysis;Cognitive;cognitive ability;cognitive development;cognitive performance;cohort;Complement;Data;Databases;Deformity;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Dimensions;Distress;Dorsal;Etiology;Family member;fascinate;frontal lobe;functional disability;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;genetic association;Genetic Materials;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Risk;Genetic Transcription;genetic variant;genome-wide;Genotype;Glutamates;healthy volunteer;Heritability;Heterogeneity;imaging genetics;Impaired cognition;in vivo;indexing;Individual;Investigation;Link;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Magnetism;Measurement;Measures;Mental disorders;Molecular Abnormality;Molecular Biology;Multimodal Imaging;multimodality;Negative Finding;neuroimaging;neuropsychiatry;Neuropsychological Tests;Neurotransmitters;novel;novel therapeutics;Patients;Pattern;Personality Character;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;protein expression;Psychotic Disorders;relating to nervous system;Relaxation;Research;Rest;Risk;risk variant;Scheme;Schizophrenia;Severities;Short-Term Memory;Siblings;Sodium Channel;Stratification;Subgroup;Susceptibility Gene;Symptoms;System;Testing;trait;treatment response;Validation;Work;","MULTIMODAL IMAGING: GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IN NEUROPSYCHIATRY",n/a,"NIMH","9589760","","",1ZIAMH002942-05,1,ZIA,MH,002942,05,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8469065","BERMAN, KAREN FAITH",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1143907,
"Autism;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD);Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Sleep Research","This past year the Sleep and Neurodevelopmental Service conducted over 120 overnight sleep studies ordered by nine different institutes. Seventy-three of those studies were performed in pediatric patients. We have collected sleep data on several distinct  cohorts including children with childhood onset schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, McCune Albright Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Sickle Cell Disease as well as for people with various disorders of neurodevelopment with both known and unknown genetic causes. We are working with our collaborators to try to identify unique sleep signals that help define the disorders under study and therefore outline paths for potential therapeutic intervention. Some of our earliest work, looking at sleep in children with autism, helped us understand that there is a lot of information in the way the brain sleeps and that sleep neurophysiology also contains important information about the way the brain matures. We recently published our findings comparing the way the brain is connected in different regions and in different states, for different groups of young children; those with autism, those with developmental delays without autism and those with typical development. We found that there were very pronounced differences in connectivity that were region-specific and most evident when the children were in slow wave sleep. We have recently completed a study of sleep neurophysiology in young children at risk for autism due to severe language delays through a natural history study of children ages 12 - 18 months (Protocol 11-M-0144, NCT01339767), where we were able to explore longitudinally how very early differences in sleep rhythms and maintenance may relate to aberrant development and the onset of autistic symptoms; that analysis and publication is forthcoming. These findings highlight the importance of looking at the sleeping brain during development for some of the earliest clues regarding neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, considerable gaps in knowledge still exist in our understanding of sleep measurements and how these change during the early periods of brain development. Filling in these gaps may aid in the earliest identification of mental health disorders. We work closely with the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service to best associate changes in the sleeping brain to neurodevelopmental stages in typical and atypical neurodevelopment. A major focus of the research arm of the Service is to develop a comprehensive battery of sleep measurements as a mainstay of clinical assessment of children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Through our efforts with researchers from many different disciplines, we hope to create and initiate standardized protocols for collecting sleep data on children. These protocols would include comprehensive behavioral assessments at the time of the sleep exam in order to best identify normal and abnormal developmental trajectories at the earliest possible opportunity.","Adult;Age;arm;Autistic Disorder;Behavior assessment;Behavioral;Brain;Child;Childhood Schizophrenia;Chronic Fatigue Syndrome;Clinical;Clinical assessments;clinical Diagnosis;cohort;Data;Development;Developmental Delay Disorders;Discipline;Disease;Genetic;Goals;Institutes;Knowledge;Language Delays;Maintenance;McCune-Albright Syndrome;Mental disorders;Natural History;neurodevelopment;Neurodevelopmental Disability;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;neurophysiology;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Pattern;pediatric patients;Phenotype;Polysomnography;Protocols documentation;Publications;Publishing;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Scientist;Services;Sickle Cell Anemia;Signal Transduction;Sleep;Sleep Disorders;Slow-Wave Sleep;Standardization;Symptoms;Therapeutic Intervention;therapeutic target;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;","SLEEP AND NEURODEVELOPMENT SERVICE",n/a,"NIMH","9568296","","",1ZICMH002962-01,1,ZIC,MH,002962,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15226871","BUCKLEY, ASHURA ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,804936,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Depression;Mental Health;Neurosciences","This project focuses on the interactions between experience and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal region of the brain. We are interested in understanding how experiences, including learning and stressful experiences, regulate adult neurogenesis and how the new neurons alter responses in these situations. We study the regulation and function of adult neurogenesis in rats and mice, which show continued production of new neurons throughout adulthood similar to that in primates, including humans. We have previously found that specifically inhibiting adult neurogenesis in mice increases their hormonal and behavioral responses to stress, increasing depressive-like behavior. During the past year, we have focused on identifying structural and behavioral changes that occur when adult neurogenesis is inhibited using pharmacogenetic manipulations in mice or rats. To do this, we used transgenic rat and mouse lines that we developed that allow us to stop neurogenesis with no side effects by feeding the animals an antiviral drug. We found that loss of new neurons affects fear and anxiety-like responses in mice that have experienced mild footshock only if the shock was ambiguously cued, or somewhat unpredictable. If mice experienced the same shock but with a cue that predicted exactly when the shock would come, the loss of new neurons had no effect on future behavior. Unpredictability is a key feature of stressors, suggesting that adult neurogenesis may alter response to stress because of its ambiguity. These findings also have implications for learning, because solutions to difficult tasks are often more ambiguous than solutions to simple tasks. We also found that inhibition of adult neurogensis in our transgenic rats alters the structure of the hippocampus, decreasing the volume of the dentate gyrus and CA3 portions of the hippocampus. Decreased hippocampal volume also occurred after chronic unpredictable stress, but the effects of stress were faster and more widespread, suggesting that decreased adult neurogenesis is not responsible for the hippocampal volume loss caused by stress and, by extension, depressive illness.","Adult;adult neurogenesis;Adverse effects;Affect;Animal Feed;Antiviral Agents;Anxiety;Behavior;Behavioral;behavioral response;Birth;Brain;Brain region;Chronic;Cues;dentate gyrus;depressive symptoms;Development;Environmental Risk Factor;experience;Fright;Future;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Hormonal;Human;interest;Learning;Mood Disorders;Mus;neurogenesis;Neurons;Pathologic;Pharmacogenetics;Population;Primates;Production;Rattus;Regulation;response;Role;Shock;Stress;stressor;Structure;Time;Transgenic Organisms;Work;","NEUROGENESIS IN THE ADULT BRAIN",n/a,"NIMH","9568254","","",1ZIAMH002784-16,1,ZIA,MH,002784,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"7348303","CAMERON, HEATHER A",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2410714,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences","In recent years, the work in my lab and that of other investigators has revealed that so-called prefrontal function, in fact, involves a broad network of areas including not only the prefrontal cortex but also the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and certain thalamic nuclei. These structures are anatomically connected in a particular way that is shared by rodents and by human and non-human primates, suggesting a mammalian network underlying the forebrain control of behavior. Its relation to the regulation of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, makes it central not only to understanding executive function, but also to schizophrenia and other disorders in humans. Our planned research is focused on understanding the functional anatomy of this circuitry. Our most recent studies have examined the function and connections of the hippocampus, which we now believe is at least as important as the prefrontal cortex for the inhibitory control of behavior. For example, like humans with disinhibitory syndromes (e.g., psychopaths, alcoholics, patients with hyperkinesis), rats with hippocampal lesions are impulsive, antisocial, and emotionally unaroused. As this circuitry is central to our understanding of a wide range of human cognitive abilities and disorders, our future research will continue to investigate its underlying neurobiology, always retaining as its focal point the measurement and quantification of behavior.In the coming years, we will investigate the interaction between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, as well as their convergent projections onto the nucleus accumbens, in certain types of decision-making behavior. Drawing from our toolbox of ablation, pharmacological blockade, and cell-type specific suppression or stimulation using genetically encoded agents, we will attempt to understand the specific types of decisions served by different pathways. For example, we recently found that some types of decisions, particularly those involving time, critically and specifically depend on the interaction between the ventral hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens (Abela et al. European J. Neurosci, 2015). For such decisions, the prefrontal cortex appears to play a relatively minor role. At the same time, the hippocampus works together with the prefrontal cortex in other categories of decisions, such as those requiring the inhibition of a prepotent response (Abela et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2013). Neurotransmitter and neuropeptide levels are known to selectively modulate the nature of this hippocampal contribution. For example, we were able to improve decision-making skills in normal rats by pharmacologically stimulating the alpha-2a-receptors directly in the ventral hippocampus, whereas stimulating dopamine D1 receptors had no such effect (Abela and Chudasama, Psychopharm. 2014). This modulation of cognitive decision-making may be related to the successful use of noradrenergic stimulants to relieve symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, where the site of action is presumed to be in the prefrontal cortex but never the hippocampus. In the past year, we have further explored the role of noradrenaline in cognitive function by focusing specifically on neuropeptides like Galanin and Neuropeptide Y, which are co-released with noradrenaline. Galanin receptors are highly expressed in both ventral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, and our preliminary data implicate ventral prefrontal Galanin receptor 1 mediated neurotransmission in impulse control mechanisms. Further experiments examining the contribution of Galanin receptors in the ventral hippocampus will provide insight into how temporal lobe structures interact with the prefrontal cortex to optimize behavioral control.  We thus plan to investigate the contribution of the hippocampus more specifically using cell-type specific inactivation. For this, we plan to combine behavioral testing with optogenetic stimulation or designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). This reversible manipulation approach will allow us to gauge the relative contributions of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, or nucleus accumbens to different types of cognitive decisions, with a high level of precision at both the behavioral and circuitry level. Understanding this interplay, as well as the effects of pharmacological agents in normalizing the contribution of these circuits, is a critical component of our research agenda that can have a direct clinical impact. In addition to the hippocampus, the thalamus has been increasingly recognized as contributing not only to the transmission of sensory and movement-related signals but also to aspects of executive function. This is particularly true of its midline nuclei, most of which have not been studied in great detail. We recently tracked putative pathways through the thalamus from the prefrontal and limbic cortex to the hippocampus using a polysynaptic virus (Prasad and Chudasama, J. Neurosci. 2013). We found that different regions of the hippocampus received input from different thalamic nuclei, which in turn received input from different cortical structures. This finding raised the question as to whether the midline thalamus is an important hub in frontotemporal circuitry, and by extension, to what extent is it a critical contributor to executive function? This question became more pressing in light of recent findings from our laboratory that ablation of one of these principal relay nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, leads to significant changes in executive behavior. Specifically, and somewhat paradoxically, we found that lesions to this structure improved animals capacity to perform on cognitive tasks by making them intensely focused, less impulsive and highly motivated (Prasad et al., Neuroscience, in press).In the past year, to get a better understanding of how the thalamus interacts with frontal and temporal structures, we conducted a series of anatomical studies to trace the connections of different thalamic structures using neurotrophic viruses such as pseudorabies (PRV), an alpha herpesvirus. These viruses are self-amplifying neuronal markers of polysynaptic neural connectivity and therefore have the capacity to delineate circuits or pathways of connected neurons by expressing fluorescent tags such as red dTomato (PRV-614) or green fluorescent protein (PRV-152) at each synaptically connected neuron. Our preliminary work has identified a topographical arrangement of cortical connections of the dorsal and ventral midline thalamic structures suggesting that the so-called non-specific midline thalamus is very specific in how it interacts with different brain regions.The behaviors following lesions of the prefrontal cortex, nucleus reuniens, and hippocampus underscore the fact that the control of executive behavior involves a broad network of structures, some of which lie outside the cortex and even outside of the telencephalon. Based on known connections and neuropharmacology, we anticipate that our understanding of this network will continue to expand and include additional brain structures, for example, particular nuclei in the hypothalamus. Importantly, the structures that underlie the control of executive behavior overlap with those that control socioemotional behavior. Socioemotional behavior is a form of social behavior that causes individuals to behave emotionally within groups and individually. This type of behavior expresses emotions such as fear, anxiety, joy and anger. It also includes complex forms of prosocial behavior such as cooperation and altruism. One major aim is the careful measurement of social behaviors with a path toward translating observations in animals to humans.","Ablation;acute symptom;Affect;Aging;Altruism;Anatomy;Anger;Animals;anti social;Anxiety;Area;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Basal Ganglia;base;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavior Control;behavior test;Behavioral;Brain;brain circuitry;Brain Diseases;Brain region;Categories;Cell Nucleus;cell type;Cerebral cortex;Characteristics;Clinical;Cognition;Cognition Disorders;Cognitive;cognitive ability;cognitive function;cognitive task;Complex;Data;Decision Making;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;Disease;Disinhibition;Dopamine;Dopamine D1 Receptor;Dorsal;effective therapy;emotion regulation;Emotional;emotional behavior;European;executive function;experimental study;Expressed Emotion;Fatigue;Fright;Galanin;galanin receptor;GALR1 Galanin Receptor;Goals;Green Fluorescent Proteins;Herpesviridae;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Hyperactive behavior;Hypothalamic structure;Impairment;improved;Impulsivity;inattention;Individual;Injury;insight;Interneurons;Laboratories;Lesion;Light;Measurement;Mediating;Medicine;Memory;Memory impairment;Mental disorders;Midbrain structure;Mind;Minor;Movement;Nature;nervous system disorder;neural circuit;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Neurobiology;Neurons;neuropeptide Y;Neuropeptides;Neuropharmacology;neuropsychiatric disorder;Neurosciences;neurotransmission;Neurotransmitters;nonhuman primate;noradrenergic;Norepinephrine;normal aging;Nucleus Accumbens;optogenetics;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pharmacology;Play;Prefrontal Cortex;problem drinker;Prosencephalon;Pseudorabies;Psychopath;psychosocial;Quality of life;Rattus;receptor;Recovery;reduce symptoms;Regulation;Rehabilitation therapy;relating to nervous system;Research;Research Personnel;response;Reuniens Thalamic Nucleus;Rodent;Role;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Series;Signal Transduction;Site;skills;social;Social Behavior;Social Controls;Social Perception;Stress;Structure;Syndrome;Telencephalon;Temporal Lobe;Thalamic Nuclei;Thalamic structure;Time;Translating;transmission process;Virus;Work;","NEURAL CIRCUITS UNDERLYING THE CONTROL OF EXECUTIVE AND EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR",n/a,"NIMH","9568284","","",1ZIAMH002951-02,1,ZIA,MH,002951,02,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14761204","CHUDASAMA, YOGITA ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1349626,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Behavioral neuroscience links systems-level circuitry to behavior, cognition and emotion and is thus critical for understanding the afflictions that affect neuropsychiatric patients. Linking cognitive changes in a behaving rat or mouse to targeted manipulations of neural circuitry requires the convergence of expertise from scientific fields inside and outside of neuroscience. In designing research projects to understand the anatomy, genetics, and pharmacology underlying the control of behavior, researchers must understand the nature of the task, its measurements, and how to interpret the data. Several steps lie between the design of the experiment and the behavioral output, including choice of task (e.g., operant vs mazes), how to train the animal (shaping vs conditioning), the type of surgical manipulation (ablation, cannulation, inactivation, stimulation, etc), and the format of data for analysis (summary vs trial-by-trial). Most neuroscience researchers who use standard off-the-shelf behavioral tasks (such as forced swim, rotarod and T-Maze) are not experts in the psychology of behavior and must therefore rely on experts in the domain of cognition. Complex cognitive behavior in rodents is often gauged by measuring the pattern of behavioral responses in tasks that involve, for example, decision-making, attention, memory, rule learning, flexibility, discrimination, and problem solving. In these tasks, rats and mice typically indicate their decisions by nose-poking visual patterns on a touchscreen like an iPad, making nose-poke entries into a series of lit holes, or depressing an extended lever triggered by time or cues. Some cognitive functions extrapolated from animal behavior have positively informed our investigation of cognitive functions in humans. Such animal-to-human approaches (e.g., delayed response) have directed the design and development of analogous tests for use in humans (e.g., self-ordered working memory). Behavioral neuroscience has also benefitted in the opposite direction by means of human-to-animal approaches as in the case of extradimensionsal/intradimensional set shifting, a test based upon the principles of the human Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Together, these advances in behavioral testing have been particularly useful in establishing the neuroanatomical and neurochemical pathology for specific cognitive deficits in a range of brain and behavior disorders. In addition to providing equipment, training and consulting for researchers interested in using rodents as models to investigate disorders of brain and behavior, one important goal for the RBC is to continue to design and develop cutting edge behavioral methods and applications while maintaining facility resources at a high level of utility for users at all levels of expertise. This requires constant maintenance and calibration of equipment, user education and interaction, and commitment to setting the standard as the best Rodent Behavioral Core facility in the world in terms of research quality.Since the RBCs inception, several PIs from NIMH as well as NINDS, NHGRI and NICHD have inquired about using it to conduct specific behavioral studies in an efficient and targeted manner. To date, the labs of 18 PIs have used the RBC facility. In some cases, we have custom designed and developed new tasks such as olfactory cue discrimination combined with navigation, ultrasonic vocalizations recordings from groups of rodent families  to measure social communication, as well as high throughput analysis of videoed tracking behavior. We have almost completed the installation of optogenetic equipment in operant chambers, and mazes and open testing arenas combined with video tracking software, as requested by many PIs. Finally, because many researchers expressed an interest in combining electrophysiological methods with awake behavior, we have initiated this installation, which should soon be functional and available to researchers. A staff scientist and technician were hired to support the operations and maintenance of the core.","Ablation;Address;Affect;Anatomy;Animal Behavior;Animal Testing;Animals;Attention;awake;base;Behavior;Behavior Control;Behavior Disorders;behavior test;Behavioral;behavioral response;behavioral study;Brain Diseases;Calibration;Cannulations;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive change;Cognitive deficits;cognitive function;Complex;Computer software;conditioning;Consult;Core Facility;Cues;Custom;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;data format;Decision Making;Depressed mood;design;Development;Discrimination;Education;Electrophysiology (science);Emotional;Emotions;Equipment;equipment training;Experimental Designs;experimental study;Family;flexibility;Genetic;Goals;Health;high throughput analysis;Human;Instruction;interest;Investigation;Learning;Link;Maintenance;Measurement;Measures;Memory;Methods;Modeling;Motor;Mus;National Human Genome Research Institute;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Nature;neural circuit;neurochemistry;neuropsychiatry;Neurosciences;Nose;operation;Operative Surgical Procedures;optogenetics;Output;Pathology;Patients;Pattern;Pharmacology;Physiological;Problem Solving;Psychology;Rattus;Research;Research Design;research facility;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resources;response;Rodent;Scientist;Sensory;Series;Shapes;Short-Term Memory;social communication;Software Design;Sorting - Cell Movement;Swimming;System;Testing;Time;tool;touchscreen;Training;Ultrasonics;United States National Institutes of Health;Visual;vocalization;Wisconsin;","RODENT BEHAVIORAL CORE: THE ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR",n/a,"NIMH","9568294","","",1ZICMH002952-02,1,ZIC,MH,002952,02,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14761204","CHUDASAMA, YOGITA ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,714057,
"Mental Health","In fiscal year 2017 (FY17) OFT administered several ongoing educational events and programs for the IRP and established new training opportunities. The OFT processed personnel cases for approximately 359 fellows including 41 Visiting Fellows and 44 Special Volunteers. The OFT provided training to all NIMH IRP administrative staff on the processing of trainee personnel cases. The OFT provided 6 faculty with Predoc IRTA slots with travel and tuition, and 6 diversity and inclusion slots for Postbac and Student IRTAs. The OFT reviewed and approved faculty requests for annual stipend increases for Postdoc IRTAs and Visiting Fellows (VFs). The OFT participated in an NIMH IRP Town Hall Meeting in January 2017 to announce NIMH IRP Responsible Conduct of Research training guidelines and to describe new OFT initiatives including the Scientific Communication Portfolio of Workshops and Seminars. Tasked with educating all new NIMH IRP staff, the OFT provided monthly orientations which covered information relevant to the NIH and NIMH organization, function and mission. The OFT also provided fellows with reference materials on ethical conduct of research and mentorship. Upon request, the OFT provided orientations for new Administrative Officers and Technicians on the administration of trainee personnel cases. The OFT web content, revised in FY14, was updated throughout FY17 to include all orientation materials and a wide array of useful resources for required trainings, career and professional development, and OFT sponsored events and awards. The OFT web content received an average of 2,319 unique page views each month in FY17. The OFT meets with trainees to provide career and professional development guidance and to solicit their feedback and input during and upon completion of their training. The OFT established a Steering Committee in FY16 composed of IRP Faculty and Trainees. In FY17 the OFT invited new faculty and staff participants to serve for the 2017/18 term.In FY 2017 the OFT sponsored and organized the 19th Annual IRP NIMH Scientific Training Day to be held in Leesburg, Virginia at the National Conference Center with the NIMH Fellows Committee. There are 236 registrations from faculty, administrators, scientific staff, and trainees to date with less than a month to the registration deadline. The Training Day is September 11, 2017. In conjunction with the Fellows Committee the OFT organized and sponsored the monthly Fellows Afternoon Neuroscience Seminar Series (FANS). FANS is a forum for Trainees to share their science, practice their presentation skills and network with their NIMH colleagues, faculty and staff.OFT organized and sponsored the IRP Grantsmanship Workshop in conjunction with Grant Writers Seminars and Workshops, LLC in FY17. Training was provided in three phases, gradually transitioning from didactic introductory material (Phase I) to an intensive grant-writing experience in the form of an individualized tutorial (Phase III). Phase I provided training in Grantsmanship to 66 trainees from NIMH, NINDS and other institutes. Seven fellows participated in Phase II, and 3 trainees participated in Phase III. This year, NIMH Trainees submitted grant proposals for K99, PRAT and private funding including NARSAD. The OFT offered seminars on the National Science Foundation (NSF) and DARPA Award mechanisms; a workshop providing guidance for the preparation of a GRFP NSF application; a panel discussion from NIMH Program Officers focused on the Strategic Initiative and scientific mission of the extramural program; and a seminar on career award mechanisms (K-Awards). To satisfy the NIH mandate to provide all NIH IRP scientific staff with training in Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR), the OFT held Ethics for Lunch discussions on Collaborative Science and Authorship from August through November, 2016. Four hundred ten NIMH IRP Scientific staff satisfied their research ethics training requirement. The OFT held a required RCR training session in July 2017 for Summer Interns. The OFT was involved with the drafting and delivery of RCR training for Postbac and Predoc IRTAs across NIH in the Fall of 2016 and drafted a curriculum for satisfying the new RCR training requirements for all NIMH IRP trainees which was posted in August 2017.In FY17, the IRTA Tax Seminar was offered in February and September. This seminar provided our NIMH IRTAs guidance in drafting and submitting both their annual and estimated taxes. These seminars cover the unique tax requirement specific to the NIH IRTA. Approximately 120 trainees attended the Tax Seminars from NIMH, NINDS, and NIDCD. In FY17 the OFT organized a series of Scientific Communication Seminars and Workshops that focused on topics including the Three-Minute-Talk (TmT). The TmT training will culminate in a final competition to be held at the Annual Scientific Training Day. Thirty-seven trainees participated in the TmT training, 15 trainees received two individualized coaching sessions and entered an NIMH IRP competition, 7 trainees are finalists and will compete at the Scientific Training Day. In 2017 the OFT offered 1:1 consultation with a communications coach for scientific presentations and job talks.  Negotiation, Interview Skills and Chalk Talk Workshops have been added to the Scientific Communication Training portfolio and organized and are to be held in FY18.The OFT coordinated, organized and held the 9 th Annual Julius Axelrod Symposium in the Porter Neuroscience Center in April of FY17 to honor the 2016 SfN Axelrod Prize recipient Dr. Robert Malenka.The OFT and Office of the Clinical Director (OCD) worked together to offer a monthly Postbac Career Discussion series from September 2016 that focused on informal discussions between fellows and faculty on pursuing academic and/or clinical career paths. The OFT administered and organized the 2016/17 IRP Investigator Seminar Series, designed to familiarize IRP fellows and faculty with their colleagues' research. The 2017/18 series will commence in October 2017 and run through June 2018.In FY17 the OFT supported 70 IRTA slots so that all NIMH Summer Interns were paid. Thirty eight Principal Investigators hired 67 Summer IRTAs using the OFT Summer Intern slots. To enhance the Summer Internship Program (SIP) experience the OFT organized a journal club taught by NIMH Postdoctoral Fellows and a picnic for the Summer Interns to encourage the trainees to network with their colleagues. This year, 47 summer interns participated in the NIH Summer Research Program Poster Day. The OFT provided weekly orientations in May/June in addition to administrative support for all interns in the SIP.In FY17 the OFT administered and directed the University College London-NIMH Joint Doctoral Training Program in Neuroscience. Sixteen applications were considered, 7 applicants were interviewed, 3 offers were made but no new students joined the program. In FY17 the OFT administered and directed the NIH-Karolinska Institutet (NIH-KI) Program for Graduate Training in the Neurosciences. With regard to NIH-KI recruiting efforts, 15 applications were considered, 8 applicants were interviewed, 3 offers were made and 3 new students joined the program. In FY17 the OFT finalized renewal of the NIH-KI joint graduate program MOU, and the NIMH-Johns Hopkins University (NIMH-JHU) joint graduate Program MOU. The OFT participated in the selection of FY17 Outstanding Resident Award Program (ORAP) award recipients and provided support for the two-day award program.","Administrator;Applications Grants;Archives;Authorship;Award;career;Career Choice;Chalk;Clinical;college;Communication;Consultations;design;Development;Development Plans;Educational Curriculum;Educational workshop;Ethics;Evaluation;Event;experience;Extramural Activities;Faculty;falls;Feedback;Fellowship;Foundations;Funding;graduate student;Grant;Guidelines;Human Resources;Individual;Institutes;International;Internet;Internships;Interview;Intramural Research;Intramural Research Program;Joints;Journals;K-Series Research Career Programs;London;Mediation;meetings;Mentors;Mentorship;Mission;multidisciplinary;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders;Neurosciences;Occupations;Participant;Phase;Postdoctoral Fellow;posters;pre-doctoral;Preparation;Principal Investigator;Privatization;Prize;Process;programs;Publications;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Ethics;Research Personnel;Research Training;Resources;responsible research conduct;Running;Science;Series;Services;skills;Students;summer research;symposium;Taxes;Training;training opportunity;Training Programs;Training Support;Travel;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Update;Virginia;Visit;Vocational Guidance;volunteer;Work;Writing;","OFFICE OF FELLOWSHIP TRAINING",n/a,"NIMH","9566800","","",1ZIJMH002916-10,1,ZIJ,MH,002916,10,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14276432","CLARK, JANET ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1369193,
"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Networking and Information Technology R&D;Neurosciences","The MEG Core staff works interactively with a large group of PIs in NIMH, NINDS, and NIDCD, and NICHD for study design, task development, acquisition protocols, signal processing and data analysis. Procedures for data security, transfer and storage have been improved by moving the main data archive to the Helix maintained NIMH data store. Work with the Scientific and Statistical Computing Core to enable transfer of CTF MEG files to AFNI and developed tools for group statistical analysis was previously extended to include an extra-dimensional format to facilitate time-based connectivity across subject groups. This has been expanded to allow time-dimension comparison across subjects and groups. The comparisons can now be analyzed using anatomic atlas based alignment across subject.Signal analysis development has continued on event-related SAM (synthetic aperture magnetometry) and 275-channel ICA (independent component analysis). Development of time-frequency analysis methods has includedincludes Stockwell and wavelet transforms as well as multi-taper techniques. The analysis packages extended to include symbolic entropy measures and transfer entropy mutual information techniques to explore brain networks are in use by a number of user groups and are now being applied to eCOG data (these are direct cortical recordings). The ability to use SAM beamformer methods to analyze MEG signals during and after tACS (transcranial alternating current stimulation) as well as tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) has allowed exploration of effects on brain rhythms and memory and several studies are now underway by Dr. Cohen's group.An early test version of the upgraded package that will replace the external electronics has beenwas tested and performed properly across all channels.last year and the final version is now scheduled for installation  Full installation is planned for fall 20176. The new eye-movement monitoring system previously installed and tested continues to contribute to cognitive activation paradigms. System reliability has been substantially improved after power system repairs. Several users are interested in pursuing studies with carefully controlled color visual stimuli. A new high quality visual stimulation system is being installed.Early work by Cornwell and colleagues demonstrated that MEG can reliably discriminate amygdala and hippocampal signals using MEG beamforming techniques. Continuing studies have shown that hippocampal function is impaired in patients with major depression as well as other brain changes when treated with ketamine. Further studies have shown that fast gamma activity in the hippocampus correlates with spatial learning. These studies are of particular interest to possibly elucidate the mechanism of the anti-depressant action of ketamine infusion. Previous results have shown that both increased anterior cingulate activity and functional connectivity during a working memory task can predict the antidepressant response of ketamine. Zarate and colleagues have utilized MEG to show that synaptic potentiation is critical for the antidepressant action in treatment resistant major depression. Previously Nugent et al. have shown group differences in MEG resting data that highlight dysfunction in major depressive disorder. This has now been extended to explore the network changes with ketamine administration. SDr Nugent has continued this work and has developed new analysis methods (multiband ICA) that high light the brain network changes across treatment and clinical groups.tudies continue to explore high gamma band activity across task and patient groups. Interaction with specific sodium channel genes finds that the cognitive differences may be related to gamma band activity.Studying how the brain organizes itself into functional networks is key to understanding normal human cognition as well as when it becomes disordered in mental illness. Previously, Bassett and co-workers using the spatial and temporal ability of MEG found that functional networks were characterized by small-world properties indicating a mix of both local connections and long range connections. We have also found differences in resting network patterns in patient groups, and have now used graph theoretical methods to examine functional networks. Functional connectivity metrics have been studied in an audio-visual task demonstrating that the communication across brain regions takes on several forms and that no one measure will suffice to capture the richness of information flow. New work by Grillon and Balderston has shown connectivity changes during anxiety manipulation.The proposed project to relate MEG dynamics to a new Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) measure for determining latency across brain regions developed by Peter Basser's group was funded and protocol planning is underway. With Drs. Coppola and Nugent as co-chairs a two-day MEG Workshop was organized to bring together the North American MEG research community. Attendance was very strong and the community felt that such a meeting was long overdue. Several panels addressed the value-added aspect of MEG neuroscience research and how a supportive infrastructure can be advanced. A follow-on meeting will be held to build collaboration and synergy across laboratories.","Address;American;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Anterior;Antidepressive Agents;Anxiety;Atlases;Auditory;base;Brain;Brain region;Chemosensitization;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive task;Collaborations;Color;Communication;Communities;Complex;Computer software;Core Facility;cranium;Data;Data Analyses;data archive;Data Collection;Data Security;design;Detection;Development;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Dimensions;Disease;Educational workshop;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Electronics;Entropy;Equipment;Event;experience;Experimental Designs;experimental study;Eye Movements;falls;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding;Genes;Graph;Head;Helmet;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Impairment;improved;independent component analysis;Information Systems;Infusion procedures;Instruction;interest;Ketamine;Laboratories;Learning;Light;magnetic field;Magnetoencephalography;Magnetometries;Major Depressive Disorder;Measures;meetings;Memory;Mental disorders;Methods;millisecond;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Monitor;MRI Scans;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders;Neurosciences Research;Nutmeg - dietary;Patients;Pattern;Photic Stimulation;Positioning Attribute;Procedures;Property;Protocols documentation;relating to nervous system;repaired;Research;Research Design;Research Infrastructure;Resistance;response;Rest;Scalp structure;Schedule;scientific computing;sensor;Sensory;Short-Term Memory;signal processing;Signal Transduction;Sodium Channel;somatosensory;Source;Statistical Computing;Statistical Data Interpretation;Stimulus;Structure;superconducting quantum interference device;Synapses;synergism;System;Techniques;Technology;temporal measurement;Testing;Time;Tissues;tool;Training;Visual;visual stimulus;Work;","NIMH MEG CORE FACILITY",n/a,"NIMH","9567429","","",1ZICMH002889-11,1,ZIC,MH,002889,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416733","COPPOLA, RICHARD ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1883022,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences;Schizophrenia;Serious Mental Illness","Our earlier basic studies have shown that MEG recordings during cognitive tasks have the ability to localize brain activity in comparable fashion to functional MRI. In specific, reduction in power in the beta frequency band at the cortex in general agrees with BOLD activation results. However, electrophysiological recordings such as the MEG/EEG have fine grained time dynamics not possible with other imaging techniques. We have also found that GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) concentration in the anterior cingulate cortex correlates with spatially localized resting MEG beta band power. We have expanded the cohort of well-matched subjects and isolated specific frequency band difference especially in the high gamma range (65 to 115 Hz).Differences in the degree of activation especially in frontal regions as indexed by beta desynchronization during a working memory task have been found between patients with schizophrenia compared to well siblings and healthy control volunteers. Previously we have seen that this activation reveals an interaction with genotype for the well-studied COMT marker. With groups of patients, siblings and controls matched for working memory task performance, patients show a distinct reduced DLPFC activation in apparent distinction to an increase in BOLD relative to task load. The MEG analysis isolates a working memory component that may reflect a different aspect of cortical processing. Recent analyses have been applied to a Sternberg memory task allowing the study of the relation of COMT to the components of memory. COMT differentially impacts MEG rhythms during the delay period compared to the recall (response). We have extended these results to examine differences in the high gamma band across groups. The relation of the different frequency bands to patterns of blood flow activation have revealed more specific targets for the neurophysiology underlying patient differences. We are now also comparing these differences in patients on and off anti-psychotic medication. It appears that medication may attenuate the PFC differences. Dani Rubenstein has completed his doctoral dissertation examining the comparison of MEG working memory activation to related fMRI and PET dopamine studies. We are also extending our genetic comparisons to examine modulation by SCN2A, a gene encoding the alpha-2 subunit of the sodium channel. Here we have now shown that the T genotype subgroup specifically shows greater high gamma band power during memory load compared to rest in middle frontal regions. This may be related to variation in cognitive performance across group, with MEG source localization showing significant differences in DLPFC and dACC for genotype by task interactions. This was presented in poster session at the Society For Biological Psychiatry annual meeting. As a follow on Carver and Fradkin have compared an auditory task MEG response that discriminate patients with schizophrenia from Healthy volunteers. This measure will be compared to neuropsychological and symptom scales to determine the biological subtype relationship. Several poster presentations have been accepted on this work.Differences in network patterns and dynamics are key to understanding underlying pathology in clinical groups. Previously Bassett et al. have shown that functional network variations in patient groups can be related to behavioral outcomes on cognitive activities. We have found distinct patterns of the temporal sequence of brain regions involved in these memory tasks that show a variety of individual differences across subjects. We are continuing to develop new measures to examine the flow of information in relation to cognitive task demand. We previously demonstrated that critical dynamics exist in resting MEG recordings. Comparison of patients with schizophrenia on similar measures suggest that their brains may operate at a different critical point that interacts with behavioral performance. New methods for uncovering the variety of network patterns have shown that cross-frequency coupling across brain regions may relate to both developmental and psychiatric trajectories.","Address;Anterior;Antipsychotic Agents;Area;Attenuated;Auditory;Behavioral;behavioral outcome;Biological;Biological Psychiatry;Blood flow;Brain;Brain region;Cereals;cingulate cortex;Clinical;Cognitive;cognitive performance;cognitive task;cohort;Coupling;Development;Dopamine;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Family member;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Genes;Genetic;Genotype;healthy volunteer;Imaging Techniques;improved;indexing;Individual Differences;information processing;Investigation;Measurement;Measures;meetings;Memory;Methods;Neurons;neurophysiology;Neuropsychology;Pathology;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Positron-Emission Tomography;posters;Protocols documentation;Resolution;response;Rest;Schizophrenia;Short-Term Memory;Siblings;Societies;Sodium Channel;source localization;Subgroup;Symptoms;Task Performances;Time;Variant;volunteer;Work;","INTEGRATING EEG/MEG AND FMRI",n/a,"NIMH","9589757","","",1ZIAMH002890-11,1,ZIA,MH,002890,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416733","COPPOLA, RICHARD ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,400368,
"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Mental Health;Networking and Information Technology R&D;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Substance Abuse","The principal mission of the Core is to help NIH researchers with analyses of their fMRI (brain activation mapping) data. Along the way, we also help non-NIH investigators, mostly in the USA but also some abroad. Several levels of help are provided, from short-term immediate aid to long-term development and planning.Consultations:The shortest term help comprises in-person consultations with investigators about issues that arise in their research. The issues involved are quite varied, since there are many steps in carrying out fMRI data analyses and there are many different types of experiments. Common problems include:- How to set up experimental design so that data can be analyzed effectively?- Interpretation and correction of MRI imaging artifacts (for example: subject head motion during scanning).- How to set up time series analysis to extract brain activation effects of interest, and to suppress non-activation artifacts?- Why don't AFNI results agree with SPM/FSL/something else?- How to analyze data to reveal connections between brain regions during specific mental tasks, or at rest?- How to recognize poor quality data?- How to carry out reliable inter-patient (group) statistical analysis, especially when non-MRI data (e.g., genetic information, age, disease rating) needs to be incorporated?- How to get good registration between the functional results and the anatomical reference images, and between the brain images from different subjects?- What sequence of programs is 'best' for analyzing a particular kind of data?- Reports of real or imagined bugs in the AFNI software, as well as feature requests (small, large, and extravagant).There are familiar themes in many of these consultations, but each meeting and each experiment raises unique questions and usually requires digging into the goals and details of the research project in order to ensure that nothing central is being overlooked. The first question asked by a user is often not the right question to answer. Complex statistical issues are often raised. Often, software needs to be developed or modified to help researchers answer their specific questions. Helping with the Methods sections of papers, or with responses to reviewers, is often part of our duties.Educational Efforts:The Core developed (and updates) a 40-hour hands-on course on how to design and analyze fMRI data that was taught twice at the NIH during FY 2017 to over 250 students. All material for this continually evolving course (software, sample data, scripts, and PDF slides) are freely available on our Web site (https://afni.nimh.nih.gov). The course material includes several sample datasets that are used to illustrate the entire process, starting with images output by MRI scanners and continuing through to the collective statistical analysis of groups of subjects. By invitation, we also taught versions of this course at 5 non-NIH sites (expenses for these trips were sponsored by the hosts): Washington U (Missouri), Vanderbilt U (Tennessee), U Chieti-Pescara (Italy), U Nebraska, and UCSD.  More than 1200 AFNI forum postings were made by Core members, mostly in answer to queries from users.Algorithm and Software Development:The longest-term support consists of developing new methods and software for fMRI data analysis, both to solve current problems and in anticipation of new needs. All of our software is incorporated into the AFNI package, which is Unix/Linux/Macintosh-based open-source and is available for download by anyone in source code (GitHub) or binary formats (Core server). New programs are created, and old programs modified, in response to specific user requests and in response to the Core's vision of what will be needed in the future. The Core also assists NIH labs in setting up computer systems for use with AFNI, and maintains an active Web site with a forum for questions (and answers) about fMRI data analysis.Notable developments during FY 2017 include:- A significant controversy erupted in mid-2016 over statistical accuracy in fMRI group studies, after a paper in PNAS was published calling into question over 40,000 papers in this field (that specific claim was later rescinded by the authors).  The Core expended significant effort to assess the magnitude of the issues raised in this paper and then fix the problems that we identified. Two new methods were developed to deal with this issue, both of which control false detections at desired level. The first method was presented in two papers (1, 2), and another paper is currently being written about the second more complex method. This newer method is more intricate, but reduces the number of arbitrary choices required of the researcher, minimizing the possibility of 'p-hacking' (searching for desirable results by playing with the analysis parameter choices). A two-hour presentation on the newer method was given to a packed room of NIH AFNI users, and the slides made available on the Web.- We provided assistance to a visiting developer from the ENIGMA group, to enable them to modify their resting state FMRI data analysis to use AFNI. Other open-source FMRI analysis software packages restrict their usage for any commercial applications, which made it impossible for the ENIGMA group to collaborate with industrial researchers.- Core programmers aided and participated in 2 workshops at the NIH: BrainHack and the Open and Reproducible Science using Python meeting.- Core scientists presented 4 posters at the Human Brain Mapping meeting in Vancouver BC in June.- Work continues in collaboration with other NIH group on brain template development, including one for macaques (now available), one for marmosets, and one for human toddlers.- Improvements were made to the 'skull stripping' (removal of the non-brain parts of 3D images) methods in AFNI, in combination with improved methods for aligning brain image datasets -- including implementation of nonlinear warping for improving alignment of functional brain images to structural brain images.Public Health Impact:From Oct 2016 to Aug 2017, the principal AFNI publication has been cited in 385 papers (cf Scopus).

"Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Mental Health;Neurosciences","This past year, our Section had the unique opportunity to support the research of various Labs & Sections within NIMH, NINDS, NICHD, and NCCIH. During the past twelve months, investigators from these labs and branches requested 465 formal projects from our staff. Each of these requests was documented and the time recorded to complete the job. In addition to the formal requests we are available daily for numerous walk-in, phone call or e-mail requests for assistance. In general, our technical support this past year can be divided into the following research areas:Electrophysiology The Section on Instrumentation staff continuously strives to improve the utility of various components that comprise electrophysiology. We have continued to improve the engineering and fabrication of multiple-hole grid arrays that allow precise, repeatable placement of a single or multiple electrodes over a wide area. We have also continued to develop small single-electrode microdrives.  Novel methods using 3D printing now allow for the production low-component count yet accurate and smooth microdrives.Single unit recording in behaving nonhuman primates is widely used to study the primate central nervous system. However, certain questions cannot be addressed without recording large numbers of neurons simultaneously. In collaboration with NIMH scientific staff, the Section on Instrumentation developed a method using 3D printing to include an individualized 3D-printed connector mounting platform, allowing for implanting and recording from 8 arrays of 96 electrodes. This technique doubles the number of arrays that have been successfully implanted in single animals. fMRIThe Section on Instrumentation provides a wide range of support for fMRI-related research. Fabrication of devices for use in MRI environments is a specialized area of expertise, with great attention given to design without ferrous metals and minimization of all metal components. In addition, commercial industrial fiber optic components and systems are evaluated and integrated into many designs and devices we fabricate.  The Section on Instrumentation supports the installation of new equipment in MRI suites, including custom mirror and projection assemblies used for stimulus presentation, and custom RF-shielded penetration panels used to route cabling.Non-Human Primate (NHP)Our group is responsible for providing a wide range of engineering and fabrication services to support non-human primate research. Many of the mechanical assemblies that are necessary for this type of research are engineered and fabricated in-house. Our group provides a diverse array of custom systems and components to many different investigators, such as custom primate chairs, high-strength restraints, MRI positioning systems, custom head coils, reward systems, data acquisition, analysis and optical response systems, plus a wide range of small mechanical components. Using the 3D print capabilities of our shop, the Section on Instrumentation is assisting neurological researchers within the NIMH and other institutes in improving their pre-surgery preparations. With data provided and converted from CT and MRI scans, our section is able to print custom and detailed models of the individual monkeys skull and brain. These skulls and brains allow the surgeon and researchers to complete some of the necessary modifications and planning before entering the operating room, reducing surgery times, decreasing risks of complications, and maintaining sterility. HumanHuman research requires the creation of many novel devices that are compatible with the high-magnetic field environment. When a new magnet is installed, we are consulted with and provide the necessary components for presenting visual stimuli in the bore of the magnet, including image periscopes, screens, and mirrors. These devices are designed and manufactured with specific space and material constraints. The Section on Instrumentation provides a substantial amount of engineering support to the Section on PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences in the Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB) in the production of short-lived radiotracers for research studies in human subjects with positron emission tomography (PET).  A bubble point test (BPT) on the sterilizing filter is required before release of a PET radiopharmaceutical.   Data logging is an important aspect of quality assurance. The Section on Instrumentation fabricated an automated data-logging BPT instrument.  The fabricated BPT instrument gives accurate, reliable and data-loggable BPT results.BehavioralSeveral different types of mazes are used to study spatial learning and memory in rats. These studies have been used to help understand general principles about learning that can be applied to humans, and to determine what effect different treatments affect learning and memory in mice. We continue to produce a variety of custom T and Y mazes for behavioral testing. When you pick up a phone, remember a phone number and dial it, you are using your working memory. Working memory is a cognitive process which maintains information for a relative short time, and is one of the most important cognitive process which is crucial to the functioning of the mind. The T-maze delayed alternation task is a classic method to assess working memory in rodents. The task consists of a sample trial, a holding period and a test trial. In the sample trial, the animal is guided into one of the two arms to get a reward. After the sample trial, the animal is kept in the holding area for several seconds. Then in the test trial, the animal needs to go to the arm which it has not been to in the sample phase to get a reward. In order to eliminate any environmental distractions such as the movement of the investigator, we fabricated an automated T-maze. It detects the position and movement of the mouse, and operates the doors and delivers rewards automatically.ImagingTwo-photon excitation microscopy is a fluorescence imaging technique that allows imaging of living tissue up to about one millimeter in depth.   Two-photon excitation can be a superior alternative to confocal microscopy due to its deeper tissue penetration, efficient light detection, and reduced phototoxicity.  The Section on Instrumentation produces a variety of equipment that supports two-photon microscopy, such as faraday cages for electronic and light shielding and custom mirror mounts.  In addition, behavioral testing equipment such as low-inertia mouse wheels are fabricated for use with two-photon microscopy.ClinicalOur Section also supports a number of clinical based research requests under the broad areas of surgical, therapeutic and basic research. Moderate and deep pressure touch are commonly utilized in massage therapy and have been linked to reductions in stress, depression, and pain. Yet there is no understanding of how pressure exerts these affective benefits.  We recently developed a custom novel  device that administers repeatable mechanical compression.  This apparatus was used to identify the most pleasant intensity, frequency, and location for pressure stimulation of the lower leg.  This device allowed the testing of the subject while undergoing fMRI to determine the brain regions that correspond to the sensory stimulation. TechnologyBy using the latest technology in advanced fabrication machinery, we are able to increase productivity and effectiveness while at the same time decreasing the amount of time needed to engineer and machine the components. Our waterjet cutter continues to increase our cutting and fabricating capabilities, especially with the multiple fiberglass parts we produce. With this system, we were able to drill a hole the approximate diameter of 4 human hairs through a ceramic screw.","3D Print;Address;Affect;Affective;Animals;Area;arm;Attention;base;Basic Science;behavior test;Behavioral;Brain;Brain region;Caliber;Ceramics;Clinical;cognitive process;Collaborations;Computer software;Confocal Microscopy;Consult;Core Facility;cranium;Custom;Data;data acquisition;design;design and construction;Detection;Development;Device Designs;Devices;distraction;Drosophila genus;Effectiveness;Electrodes;Electronic Mail;Electrophysiology (science);Engineering;Environment;Equipment;experience;Fiber Optics;fiberglass;fluorescence imaging;Frequencies;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Hair;Head;Hour;Human;human subject;Image;Imaging Techniques;Implant;improved;Individual;Industrialization;Insecta;Institutes;instrument;instrumentation;Learning;Leg;Light;Link;Location;locust;magnetic field;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Massage;Mechanics;Memory;Mental Depression;Metals;Methods;Microscope;Microscopy;millimeter;Mind;Mission;Modeling;Modification;molecular imaging;Monkeys;Movement;MRI Scans;Mus;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Neuraxis;Neurologic;Neurons;new technology;Noise;nonhuman primate;novel;Occupations;Operating Rooms;Operative Surgical Procedures;Optics;Pain;Penetration;Perfusion;Phase;Phonation;Phototoxicity;Positioning Attribute;Positron-Emission Tomography;Preparation;pressure;Primates;Printing;Production;Productivity;prototype;quality assurance;Radiochemistry;Radiopharmaceuticals;radiotracer;Rattus;Recommendation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;research study;Research Support;response;restraint;Rewards;Risk;Rodent;Route;Sampling;Science;Scientist;sensor;Sensory;Services;Short-Term Memory;Sterility;Stimulus;Stress;Surgeon;surgical research;System;Techniques;Technology;Telephone;Test Result;Testing;Therapeutic Human Experimentation;Time;Tissues;Touch sensation;two-photon;visual stimulus;Walking;X-Ray Computed Tomography;","NIMH INSTRUMENTATION CORE FACILITY",n/a,"NIMH","9568293","","",1ZICMH002911-10,1,ZIC,MH,002911,10,,Unavailable,"","","",,"10687787","DOLD, GEORGE ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1363776,
"Anxiety Disorders;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Depression;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences","The neuropeptide slow transmitters PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide) and arginine vasopression (AVP) are released at synapses that transduce stress responses to the brain, and mediate homeostatic and allostatic adjustments to stress by the organism. The catecholamine transmitter DA (dopamine) is released at synapses that transduce reward and mediate response to psychomotor stimulant drugs of abuse. Allostatic responses to systemic and psychogenic stressors, shown to be PACAP-dependent, are implicated as causative factors in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress is implicated as a driver of both decreased reward drive (anhedonia), and of anxious behavior, both contributory to depression, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) occurring in humans. DA neurotransmission is thought to underlie organismic drive for reward, as well as to mediate both the rewarding properties of psychomotor stimulants, and the likelihood of relapse to drug-seeking behavior that can be triggered by stress. Thus, these two systems (DAergic and PACAPergic) are likely to strongly interact. The extrahypothalamic projections of vasopressinergic magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are also being explored as modulators of stress and sex-hormone-dependent inputs to amygdala and lateral habenula (LHb) that control motor responses (including exploration and escape) to threat-related stressful stimuli. Understanding the cellular mechanisms of stress transduction, and stress interaction with reward circuitry, at the circuit, cellular and molecular levels is crucial to developing effective therapeutic interventions for these disorders.PACAP, DA, and AVP act through Gs- or Gq-coupled G-protein receptors (GPCRs) on target cells (neurons) of the brain, exerting their actions as first through a precisely time-dependent elevation of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) or other second messengers including calcium. For Gs-coupled signaling via cAMP, we have identified distinct contributions of the three major cAMP sensors PKA, Epac (Rapgefs 3 and 4), and NCS/Rapgef2 to cAMP-dependent processes carried out by NS-1 neuroendocrine cells and primary neurons in cellula (A.C. Emery, M.V. Eiden and L.E. Eiden, J.Biol. Chem. 289: 10126, 2014; A.C. Emery et al., ACS Chemical Neuroscience DOI: 10.102/acschemneuro.6b00462; A.C. Emery et al., J. Biol. Chem.DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M117.790329). Either of the two first messengers, PACAP and DA, alluded to above as important in stress transduction and in reward, activate these three 'parcellated' cAMP-dependent pathways. The relative contributions of the three cAMP-dependent pathways to the actions of PACAP and DA at the specific post-synaptic sites that characterize the stress response and reward micro-circuitry of the mammalian CNS are under investigation. How these intracellular mechanisms determine the interaction between PACAPergic and DAergic neurotransmission that ultimately leads to the depressogenic and anxiogenic effects of stress, the rewarding characteristics of psychomotor stimulants, and the stress x reward interactions that blunt hedonia and increase anxiety in stress-associated affective disorders, and in stress-associated relapse to drug-seeking behavior are being studied in mice in which components of these signaling systems are deleted in specific brain areas. We are focusing on the relative contributions of the three sensors to cAMP-dependent effects mediated by the Gs-coupled PACAP receptor PAC1, and the dopamine D1 receptor, in the extended amygdala and in the ventral striatum, respectively, during the processes of development of chronic stress-induced anxious/depressive behavior, and psychomotor stimulant-induced plasticity of medium spiny neurons, respectively. These studies now involve examination, using neurochemical, histochemical, and tracing methods, micro-circuitry of PACAPergic innervation in both extended amygdala and in the ventral striatum. Although PACAPergic cell bodies, and PACAPergic nerve terminals have been extensively characterized in the rodent brain, the connections between them (i.e. the circuits in which they function, including those modulating reward and anxiety) remain largely uncharacterized, as do their interactions with dopaminergic reward circuits in ventral striatum. We have recently determined that PACAP-dependent effects on corticosterone secretion in response to a single episode of restraint stress (at the level of PACAPergic innervation of CRH neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, i.e. hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA axis activation) can be dissociated from PACAP-dependent effects on behavior (hypophagia) associated with this stressor (S. Z. Jiang et al., Stress 19: 374, 2016). These results imply that PACAPergic circuitry underlying HPA axis activation is separate from PACAPergic circuitry underlying suppression of feeding (stress-associated anorexia), and that post-synaptic PACAP effects on CRH neurons (affecting long-term CRH synthesis without affecting immediate CRH secretion) must be fundamentally different from post-synaptic PACAP effects on the neurons mediating acute restraint stress-dependent effects on feeding. This work forms the basis for our continuing efforts to define PACAPergic functional circuits involved in stress responding and in modulation of DAergic neurotransmission relevant to reward, and the cAMP-dependent and -independent post-synaptic intracellular signaling pathways that are finally responsible for the physiological regulation of stress responding by these two neurotransmitters in the brain.An additional project related to GPCR ligand-mediated stress responding in the brain, in collaboration with Dr. Limei Zhang-deBarrio, visiting Fulbright Scholar, UNAM, Mexico, involves identification and tracing of vasopressinergic magnocellular neurons projecting to amygdala and habenula, and linking anxiety and escape behavior response modification by environmental and homeostatic cues including thirst and sex hormone status in the behaving rat. These studies extend the concept that neuropeptides functioning as hormones upon secretion from the hypothalamus for homeostatic regulation also coordinate allostatic responses to the environment through their projections to extrahypothalamic brain( V. S. Hernndez et al., Frontiers in Neuroal Circuits DOI: 10.3389/fncir.2016.00092; and L.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Genetics;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Advances in molecular genetic techniques are revealing new details of the neuroanatomical organization of brain circuitry and the functional role of these circuits in behavior. Engineered viral vector constructs have been developed to label axonal projections of targeted neurons with unprecedented clarity, while others allow for retrograde trans-synaptic labeling of neurons providing inputs or anterograde trans-synaptic labeling of post-synaptic targets of axonal projections. Development of optogenetic and DREADD techniques provide the ability to functionally manipulate neural circuits to study their role in behavior while calcium indicators provide the ability to analyze the physiologic activity in targeted neuron populations. Together these approaches provide new insights into the functional organization of neural circuits. For example, optogenetic studies, using light activation of Channel Rhodopsin (ChR), have demonstrated the ability to functionally manipulate specific neural pathways to determine their role in behaviors including fear memory, anxiety, feeding, and movement. The analytic potential of these approaches is enhanced by the ability to target specific neuron populations, which are defined components of neural circuits. One approach involves the use of transgenic Cre-driver mouse lines in which Cre-recombinase is expressed under the control of gene-specific promoters. In recent years we characterized BAC-Cre driver lines from the GENSAT project that allow for targeting components of the neural circuits of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Of particular significance, lines were characterized with selective labeling in cortical layer 2/3, in layer 4, in layer 5 and in layer 6. Each of these cortical layers contain neuron subtypes with distinct axonal projection patterns. These BAC-Cre lines provide unprecedented ability to study the specific function of these cortical subtypes in behavior.In the past year we collaborated with investigators at NIDA, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Janelia Farms Research, and the Salk Institute in studies that used the BAC-Cre lines to determine the relationship between the organization of information transfer between sensory, motor and association cortical areas and the planning and initiation of movements. During this year neuroanatomical techniques were developed to analyze the functional organization of the relationship between the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Our work focuses on the organization of neural circuits responsible for integrating different modes of sensory and experiential information that is utilized in the planning and execution of behavior. To do this we use viral vectors that label the axons of specific cortical neuron subtypes in GENSAT BAC-Cre mouse lines. Viral vectors injected into different cortical areas in BAC-Cre lines expressing in cortical layers 2/3 and 5a map the connections between functional cortical areas, which are responsible for integration of information, while injections in BAC-Cre lines expressing in layers 5b and 6 label axonal projections to subcortical systems, which are involved in turning cortical activity into behavior. The labeled axons are visualized using immunohistochemical techniques in 50m sections of the brain and imaged to reveal multiple injections in different cortical areas reveal specific patterns of connectivity between functionally distinct cortical areas and subcortical systems. To analyze these complex patterns of connectivity we developed an efficient process for reconstructing the images through the whole mouse brain using the NIH ImageJ program (Paletzki and Gerfen, 2015). These fully reconstructed whole mouse brain image sets displaying the axonal projections of specific neuron subtypes in multiple cortical cortical areas are registered to a common mouse brain atlas. The ability to register patterns of axonal projections obtained from many brains provides the ability to analyze the complex organization of the neural circuits integrating information between functional cortical areas and how it is transmitted to subcortical circuits responsible for behavior. Work with the Janelia MouseLight Project provides an exciting advance in analysis of the connectivity of cortical neural circuits (Economo et al., 2016). The MouseLight Project has developed a platform for tracing the axonal projections of individual cortical neurons through the whole brain The axonal projections of individual cortical neurons project collaterals to as many as 15 cortical or subcortical areas. In some cases the total axonal length of an individual neurons axon collaterals has been shown to be 10 to 15 cm, which is quite remarkable considering that the mouse brain is approximately 1.5 cm in length from the frontal cortical pole to the cerebellum. The MouseLight Project goal is to provide the axonal projections of 1000 individual neurons over a 2 year period, which will provide a major resource for understanding the organization of brain circuits.We collaborated with the Karpova and Looger labs at Janelia Farms on their development of Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector variants engineered as efficient retrograde axonal transport markers (Tervo et al., 2016).  Viral vectors are versatile tools for tracing axonal connections as they may be combined with other genetic tools such as Cre-driver lines or GCamp to analyze neuronal activity.  While AAV vectors are most efficiently taken up by the neuronal soma, the Janelia group developed variants that are transported retrogradely from axonal terminals.  This provides an important new research tool. In addition, with the Janelia groups we published a paper reviewing the recent advances in neuroanatomical tract tracing (Gerfen et al., 2017).In a collaboration with the Svoboda lab at Janelia Farms to study brain circuits responsible for movement, we demonstrated that a circuit between the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and the thalamus is responsible for the persistent activity that is preparatory to the initiation of specific behavior (Guo et al., 2017).  In two studies analyzing the organization of basal ganglia circuits advantage was taken of BAC-Cre reporter lines we developed for the GENSAT project (Gerfen et al., 2013)  that express Cre selectively in  either the patch or matrix compartments of the striatum.  In one study, modified rabies virus was used to trans-synaptically label the inputs to striatal patch or matrix neurons from the cerebral cortex (Smith et al. 2016). This study extended my work (Gerfen, 1989) that showed cortical inputs to the striatal compartments are related to their laminar distribution.  In another study using AAV vectors to trace axonal projections, we demonstrated that striatal patch neurons selectively target dopamine neuron dendrites in the midbrain (Crittenden et al., 2017).A collaboration with the Lin lab at NIDA analyzed the activity of striatal direct and indirect pathway neurons during movement (Barbera et al., 2016).  A long standing model of the basal ganglia suggests that activity in the direct pathway facilitates movement while activity in the indirect pathway inhibits movement.  Using an innovative approach to visualize the activity of striatal neurons using a molecular marker that is loaded selectively into direct or indirect pathway neurons using BAC-Cre reporter lines, it was possible to monitor the activity in a population of striatal neurons while an animal was awake and moving.  Results showed that both direct and indirect pathway neurons are active during movement, but that clusters of neurons of similar neuron type are active at distinct times during the movement.  This finding demonstrates that the striatal pathway that inhibits movement plays an important role during movement.","Accelerometer;adeno-associated viral vector;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Anterior;Anxiety;Area;Atlases;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;awake;Axon;Axonal Transport;Basal Ganglia;Basal Ganglia Diseases;Behavior;Behavior Control;Brain;brain circuitry;Brain imaging;Brain region;calcium indicator;Cerebellum;Cerebral cortex;Clinical;clinical movement disorder;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Corpus striatum structure;Dendrites;Development;Disease;Dopamine;Dopamine D2 Receptor;dopaminergic neuron;Engineering;Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase;Enzymes;Farming environment;fear memory;Feedback;feeding;Functional disorder;Funding;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic Engineering;Genetic Techniques;Glutamates;Goals;Image;Individual;information organization;Injectable;Injection of therapeutic agent;innovation;insight;Institutes;interest;Label;Laboratories;Lateral;Length;Lesion;Light;LoxP-flanked allele;Maps;Mediating;Medical;Mental disorders;Methods;Midbrain structure;Modeling;Molecular Genetics;molecular marker;Motor;Motor Cortex;Movement;Mus;National Institute of Drug Abuse;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;neural circuit;Neural Pathways;Neuroanatomy;Neuromodulator;neuronal cell body;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Neurosciences Research;Neurotransmitter Receptor;optogenetics;Other Genetics;Output;Paper;Parkinson Disease;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Physiological;Play;Population;Process;programs;promoter;Prosencephalon;protein activation;Protein Kinase;Psychotropic Drugs;Publishing;Rabies virus;Regulation;relating to nervous system;Reporter;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;response;retrograde transport;Rhodopsin;Role;Sensory;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction Pathway;Synapses;System;Techniques;Thalamic structure;Time;tool;transcription factor;Transcriptional Activation;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Viral Vector;Work;","FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX AND BASAL GANGLIA",n/a,"NIMH","9568245","","",1ZIAMH002497-28,1,ZIA,MH,002497,28,,Unavailable,"","","",,"2034559","GERFEN, CHARLES R",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,151741,
"Anxiety Disorders;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences","This project has identified core psychological and behavioral findings and their underlying neural mechanisms related to anxiety and anxiety disorders. Using a high-resolution 7 Tesla scanner, we have mapped the functional connectivity of small structures that are key nodes of the brain circuits underlying fear and anxiety, including the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the habenula. We have also characterized the effects of normal anxiety and pathological anxiety on neurocognitive and neurobehavioral processes. This work provides clues as to the boundary between normal and abnormal mechanisms. It also helps identify clinical biomarkers, i.e., processes that distinguish normal from abnormal anxiety. Our approach is to elucidate normative psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of fear and anxiety in healthy subjects to identify perturbations of these mechanisms in anxious people (i.e., individuals with an anxiety disorder). Fear is an adaptive response to threat that enables organisms to efficiently confront an imminent threat via emergency flight or fight responses. Anxiety, which develops when the threat becomes more durable and uncertain, is a sustained state of apprehension. Anxiety is a state of worries, hypervigilance, and behavioral inhibition. Our Section studies anxiety as a normal emotion and as a pathological state (i.e., anxiety disorders). The normal state of emotion is induced by having subjects anticipating mildly unpleasant shock delivered on one wrist. Before the experiment begins, the subjects set the shock at a level that is uncomfortable but tolerable. Although much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying fear and anxiety, both from animal and human literature, how these circuitries differ from one another, and, particularly how they are uniquely modulated, is still unclear, especially in humans. The advent of new powerful neuroimaging scanners has enabled us to gain better insights into small brain structures that mediate fear and anxiety, the CeA and the BNST. The main result is that the amygdala and the BNST are connected to many of the same structures that have been identified in animals, suggesting close anatomical conservation across mammalian species (Gorka et al., in press). However, we also found new connections with the BNST, especially in cortical regions, which have not been described in animals. These include the ventromedial, ventrolateral, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the precuneus, regions that are involved in cognition, emotion regulation, and cognitive control. Finally, we found that the amygdala is preferentially connected to structures processing the internal state of the body and sensory information and the BNST with cortical regions involved in threat appraisal and self-referential processing (Gorka et al., in press). This better understanding of the connectivity of the CeA and BNST will help gain insights into the functional role of these structures.In general, to make a diagnosis, clinicians rely on signs, which can be observed and quantified (e.g., thermometer to measure temperature), and symptoms, which are subjective information gathered via patients self-report and clinicians observation of patients. One of the main impediments to progress in anxiety research is that, unlike for many medical conditions, where a blood or urine test can help identify signs of disorders, there are no objective signs associated with anxiety disorders. The discovery of new treatments for anxiety disorders will depend on discovering objective signs of anxiety disorders. To this end, our Section attempts to identify objective signs of the attentional and behavioral symptoms of anxiety using cognitive tasks that probe basic mechanisms associated with anxiety such as hypervigilance and behavioral inhibition. Our findings show that normal anxiety facilitates the detection of environmental threat and novelty, and promotes a cautious behavioral stance combined with a better ability to stop prepotent (ongoing) responses. We have started to identify the brain circuits responsible for these adaptive behaviors. For example, threat detection is improved via increased connectivity between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, novelty detection by suppressing the normal feedback in a circuit that includes the auditory cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus, and the facilitation of response inhibition is associated with greater activation of a right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated in sustained attention and motor inhibition. The next step will be to establish whether anxiety disorders are associated with perturbation in these circuits.Critically, this work has the potential to dramatically change our approach to classification and treatment of anxiety disorders, and hopefully to improve the life of people suffering from anxiety.","Adaptive Behaviors;Adult;Adverse effects;American;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Animal Experimentation;Animals;Anti-Anxiety Agents;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;anxiety symptoms;anxious;Arousal;Attention;Auditory area;Base of the Brain;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral inhibition;Behavioral Symptoms;Blood;Brain;Brain imaging;Cell Nucleus;Child;Classification;clinical biomarkers;clinical efficacy;Cognition;cognitive control;cognitive task;Comorbidity;Complex;cost;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;dorsal raphe nucleus;drug discovery;Emergency Situation;emotion regulation;Emotions;endophenotype;experimental study;Feedback;Feeling;fighting;Fright;Habenula;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;improved;Individual;Inferior frontal gyrus;innovation;insight;Intervention;Knowledge;Life;Literature;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Mediation;Medical;Motor;neural circuit;neural correlate;neurobehavioral;neurobiological mechanism;Neurobiology;Neurocognitive;neuroimaging;neuromechanism;Organism;Pathologic;Pathological anxiety;Patient observation;Patient Self-Report;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;psychologic;Psychopathology;Psychopharmacology;Psychophysiology;Public Health;Reaction;relating to nervous system;Research;Resolution;response;Role;Sensory;Shock;statistics;Structure;Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region;Study Section;Superior temporal gyrus;sustained attention;Symptoms;Teenagers;Temperature;Testing;Thermometers;Time;tool;treatment of anxiety disorders;Urine;vigilance;Work;Wrist;","THE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY OF FEAR AND ANXIETY",n/a,"NIMH","9569194","","",1ZIAMH002798-16,1,ZIA,MH,002798,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14110566","GRILLON, CHRISTIAN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2361159,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Genetics;Mental Health;Neurosciences;Sleep Research","Research projects carried during the Fiscal Year 20171- Contribution of rod/cone photoreceptors to non-image functions:In 2010, we published that rods and melanopsin phototransduction are complementary for signaling light to circadian photoentrainment (Altimus et al., Nature Neurosci 2010) and recently we showed the same for the Pupillary light reflex (Keenan et al., eLife 2016). We have now begun to determine the contribution of rods and cones to other non-image behaviors including acute body temperature regulation. We found that the retinal circuits that underlie the effects of light on body temperature regulation are distinct from those for circadian photoentrainment and we are in the process of determining why these differences exist by using the new behavioral setup that is being built at NIMH.2- Defining the retinal and brain circuits that drive circadian photoentrainment and phase shifts:We have generated genetically modified mouse lines to uncover the contribution of ipRGC subtypes and the corresponding brain circuits to the synchronization of the internal biological clock to the solar day. We have animals that either harbor only the SCN-projecting ipRGCs (Chen et al., Nature 2011) or lack the ipRGCs that project to the SCN (unpublished). This will allow us to determine the contribution of individual subtypes of ipRGCs to circadian photoentrainment and phase shifts. The phase of the circadian oscillator can be advanced or delayed by acute pulses of light, known as phase shifts. Our exciting preliminary data reveal that different populations of ipRGCs control phase delays versus phase advances in the circadian oscillator. This finding challenges the current view in the field that similar mechanisms underlie phase advances and phase delays, and that light has a simple ON/OFF effect on the clock. Future studies will determine which ipRGC populations are necessary for advances versus delays, and map the brain regions that are influenced by light to cause changes in the phase of the circadian oscillator.3- Molecular and functional characterization of the 200 M1-Brn3b-negative ipRGCs:We recently made a startling discovery that a subpopulation of ipRGCs (200 M1-Brn3b-negative, which we called circadian photoreceptors) is critical for the development of the circadian clock as well as vision, although they do not project to visual centers (Chew et al., eLife 2017). An exciting hypothesis is that these 200 ipRGCs (Chen et al., Nature 2011) represent an evolutionary ancient photoreceptor class given their broad influence on several distinct behaviors (photoentrainment, development of the clock and vision as well as local pupillary light reflex). Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular and functional specification of this population in relation to other ipRGCs and conventional ganglion cells. Thus, we have started to examine the transcriptome and epigenetic marks of this population using our resources at NIMH. This project will provide the molecular handles to understand the ontogeny and the functional specialization of the 200 M1 ipRGCs in relation to other ipRGCs and conventional ganglion cells.4- SCN-neuropeptides in regulating light-mediated effects on sleep:The SCN is believed to influence circadian rhythms primarily by direct efferent connections with downstream brain regions. The SCN produces several neuropeptides including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin releasing peptide (Grp), prokineticin-2 (Prok2), and arginine-vasopressin (Avp). These neuropeptides are thought to synchronize cellular oscillators within the SCN. However, whether they are capable of entraining downstream oscillators is unclear. A major obstacle to the study of SCN neuropeptide functions in controlling downstream oscillators has been the availability of animal models that still have SCN synchrony but lack neuropeptide expression.We have generated a mouse model that lacks the expression of major SCN neuropeptides but maintains synchronous cellular oscillations in the SCN. This allows us, for the first time, to specifically address the necessity and sufficiency of SCN neuropeptides in regulating circadian behaviors. In collaboration with Seth Blackshaw (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine), we conditionally deleted a LIM homeodomain transcription factor, Lhx1, specifically in the SCN (Six3-Cre;Lhx1lox/lox henceforth called Lhx1 mutant mice). We found that Lhx1-mutants exhibit a dramatic downregulation in the levels of the major SCN neuropeptides, Vip, Grp, Avp and Prok2. Notably, the maturation of SCN, the core SCN clock-work and clock-controlled gene expression are still preserved (Bedont et al., Cell Reports 2014). Lhx1-mutant mice exhibit modest deficits in the circadian output behavior of wheel running activity, but importantly, we observed profound deficits in sleep regulation by light (Bedont et al., Current Biology 2017). We will determine the necessity of the SCN neuropeptides in controlling sleep. 5. An Lhx6-neuronal population regulates sleepIn an exciting collaboration with Seth Blackshaw's lab, we found an undefined population of Lhx-6 GABA neurons in the zona incerta regulate sleep (Liu, Nature 2017). Together, we will continue to break new ground about how light signaling from the environment regulates several functions that are essential for the well-being of humans.","Acute;Address;Animal Model;Animals;Area;Argipressin;base;Behavior;behavior influence;Behavioral;Behavioral Assay;Biological Clocks;Biology;Birth;Brain;Brain region;Cell physiology;Cells;circadian pacemaker;Circadian Rhythms;Collaborations;Data;Development;Down-Regulation;Electrophysiology (science);Environment;Epigenetic Process;Exhibits;Future;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;ganglion cell;Gastrin releasing peptide;Gene Expression;Genetic;Growth;Health;homeodomain;Human;Image;improved;in vivo;Individual;Learning;Life;Light;light effects;Maps;Measures;Mediating;medical schools;melanopsin;Memory;Molecular;Moods;Morphology;mouse model;Mus;mutant;Mutant Strains Mice;National Institute of Mental Health;Nature;neural circuit;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Output;Pathway interactions;Phase;Photoreceptors;Photosensitivity;Phototransduction;Physiologic pulse;Physiologic Thermoregulation;Population;Process;Publishing;Pupil light reflex;receptor;Reporting;Research;Research Project Grants;Resources;response;Rest;Retina;Retinal;Retinal Cone;Retinal Ganglion Cells;retinal rods;Running;Signal Transduction;Sleep;sleep regulation;Stimulus;Therapeutic;Time;transcription factor;transcriptome;Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide;Vertebrate Photoreceptors;Vision;Visual;Work;zona incerta;","SECTION ON LIGHT AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS",n/a,"NIMH","9589764","","",1ZIAMH002964-01,1,ZIA,MH,002964,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15265879","HATTAR, SAMER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2706124,
"Anxiety Disorders;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Depression;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)","Chronic psychosocial stress has been implicated in the etiology and progression of psychiatric disorders such as major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In mice, we study the effects of psychosocial stress in a conflict paradigm that leads to behavioral alterations such as deficits in social interaction or increases in anhedonia, anxiety, and depressive-like states. In our social defeat paradigm, two mice are placed in a continuous dyadic living relationship in which the subordinate experimental mouse is chronically exposed to and periodically defeated by a dominant mouse. Over the course of weeks in this living situation, the experimental mouse develops anxious and depressive-like behaviors that are associated with distinct neurochemical alterations in identified brain circuits. A decreased rate of hippocampal neurogenesis is one well-documented readout of stress effects. Thus the paradigm is an ethologically relevant and validated model that can provide insights into the bases for mental illness in humans. Our research focuses on the roles played by immune factors in the etiology of psychosocial stress-induced depressive states. We hypothesize that there is a bidirectional dialog between the brain and the immune system that serves to maintain homeostasis in healthy states, but disturbances within this dialog lead to homeostatic corrections or dysfunction that contribute to the onset and course of psychiatric disease. Therefore, we measure immune system parameters as we manipulate psychosocial processes that affect brain states.  Two projects investigate immune changes in rodents undergoing psychological stress; one focuses on the role of the adaptive immune system in maintaining homeostatic balance, and the second investigates stress-induced changes in immune cells and molecules within the brain itself.1) We conducted experiments aimed at addressing the role of the adaptive immune system in controlling mood states in the chronic social defeat (CSD) model. The adaptive immune system, separate from the innate immune system, comprises cells  lymphocytes  that adapt, i.e., acquire and retain a memory of prior challenges. Surprisingly, lymphocytes appear to exert effects on the brain and behavior as suggested by results of lymphocyte transfer experiments. We developed a novel approach to the question by studying the Rag2-/- mouse, which lacks a gene needed to produce mature lymphocytes. We adoptively transferred lymphocytes into this lymphopenic mouse from normal donor mice that had either been chronically stressed or unstressed, and after two weeks of lymphocyte reconstitution in the host mouse, behavioral tests and hippocampal cell proliferation assays were performed. The mice that received cells from defeated mice showed anti-depressive and anxiolytic behaviors relative to mice that received no cell transfer or transfer of cells from home-cage control mice. These surprising findings suggested that the adaptive immune system retains a memory for adverse events and attempts to return the host animal to a condition of homeostasis.  Current work examines the molecular and cellular determinants of the interaction and the anatomical and humoral pathways by which the immune system affects brain function and structure. We are particularly focused on the meninges as a site of interaction between the periphery and the brain.  The meninges are a special component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) because immune cells only very sparsely enter the brain itself but do reside in the subarachnoid spaces of the meninges where they can release bioactive molecules that circulate in the interstitial cerebrospinal fluid to widely influence brain activity.  Whole-mount meningeal preparations and flow cytometry of cells residing in the meninges are used to analyze lymphocytes in this compartment.  We characterize activation states and gene expression profiles in these cells.  The profiles guide us to program lymphocytes in cell culture to display similar properties.  The goal is to introduce cultured cells into an animal with dysregulated affect to confer antidepressant properties.  Such studies may lead to insights into new targets for therapeutic interventions in psychiatric disorders.2) The immune system comprises cells of peripheral immune organs and also specialized immune cells within the brain  microglia  that share many properties with peripheral myeloid-derived cells.  Our recent research showed that CSD triggered a CNS immune response within emotion-processing brain areas, which may be one basis for our finding that chronically stressed mice had reduced levels of myelination in the prefrontal cortex. We have data showing effects of acute and chronic social defeat stress on microglial proliferation and activation states in the prefrontal cortex.  These activation states can affect glial and neuronal function, which may differentially direct behavioral outcomes associated with either susceptibility or resilience to the effects of the stress.  We have analyzed microglia isolated by flow cytometry to characterize cell-surface markers of activation and by microarray to assess gene expression patterns. The microarray data indicated that microglia isolated from defeated mice that had been susceptible to the depressive effects of social defeat were functionally distinct from microglia taken from defeated mice that showed behavioral resilience to the stress procedure. The microglial gene expression characteristics of the resilient group were more like those from unstressed control mice, suggesting that microglial activity contributes to the brain states that afford resilience to the effects of psychosocial stress.  Gene expression profiles in the microglia from susceptible mice showed evidence of inflammation, phagocytosis, extracellular matrix breakdown, oxidative stress, and extravasation.  These findings were assayed by histochemical and ex vivo assay methods.  In the susceptible mice only, local breeches of the BBB and brain micro-bleeds were found.  These were associated with microglial immunostaining of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-8 and MMP-9, which indicate degradation of the extracellular matrix.  Susceptible mice also showed elevated levels of hydidroethidium (DHE) in cells, indicating increased levels of oxidative stress.  Drugs that prevent the conversion of microglia to a reactive pro-inflammatory state seen in the susceptible group may protect the animals from the depressive effects of the defeat stress.  In one experiment, drugs that block matrix metalloproteinase activity were effective, In another experiment, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibitor N-acetyl cysteine was effective.  Studies are underway to explore the role played by microglia in these effects by depleting microglia using the CSF-1R antagonist drug PLX5622. The aims of the work are to demonstrate a causal relationship between stress-induced immune alterations and susceptibility or resilience to the stress, and to suggest new therapeutic targets for the treatment of stress-related mood disorders.","Acute;acute stress;Adaptive Immune System;Address;Adoptive Transfer;Adverse event;Affect;Affective;Anatomy;Anhedonia;Animals;Anti-Anxiety Agents;Antidepressive Agents;Anxiety;anxious;Area;Back;base;Behavior;behavior test;Behavioral;behavioral outcome;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;brain behavior;Brain region;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Proliferation;Cell surface;cell type;Cells;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Characteristics;Chemistry;Chronic;Chronic stress;Conflict (Psychology);Cultured Cells;Cysteine;Data;depressive symptoms;Elements;Emotional;Emotions;Endocrine;Endocrine system;Equilibrium;Etiology;Event;experimental study;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Degradation;Extravasation;feeding;Flow Cytometry;Functional disorder;Gelatinase B;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Home environment;Homeostasis;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologic Factors;Immunologics;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;inhibitor/antagonist;Innate Immune System;insight;interstitial;Lead;Life;Lymphocyte;Major Depressive Disorder;Matrix Metalloproteinases;Mature Lymphocyte;Measures;Memory;Meningeal;Meninges;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Methods;Microglia;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mood Disorders;Moods;Mus;myelination;Myelogenous;Neuraxis;neurochemistry;neurogenesis;Neuroimmune;Neurons;Neutrophil Collagenase;new therapeutic target;novel strategies;Organ;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Phagocytosis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Play;post-traumatic stress;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Predisposition;Prefrontal Cortex;Preparation;prevent;Procedures;Process;programs;Property;psychologic;Psychological Stress;psychological stressor;psychosocial;Psychosocial Stress;Reactive Oxygen Species;reconstitution;Research;resilience;Risk Factors;Rodent;Role;Site;social;Social Interaction;Stress;stressor;Structure;Subarachnoid Space;Therapeutic Intervention;therapy development;tool;toxicant;Treatment/Psychosocial Effects;Work;","STUDIES OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY",n/a,"NIMH","9568240","","",1ZIAMH001090-40,1,ZIA,MH,001090,40,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6482341","HERKENHAM, MILES A.",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1739164,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Mental Health;Neurosciences","In one project, we are examining how particular sets of neurons are chosen by the brain to guide decisions.  Whenever humans or animals see sensory stimuli, many brain areas are activated.  We hypothesize that there are particular representations  particular patterns  that are created in each brain area, some of which are optimized for decoding and some of which are optimized for other kinds of information processing.  We are training mice to report perception of sets of visual stimuli which have decodable representations in different cortical regions.  This work will shed light on which areas the brain decodes for behavior, and why it chooses those areas for decoding. In a second project, to understand how neuronal activity patterns give rise to behavior, we have adopted a new technology that extends a two-photon microscope to stimulate both single neurons and patterns of individual neurons.  This approach is the first to allow changes in neural activity patterns in mammals during behavior, and it opens the door to studying how animals' choices depend on patterns of neuronal activity.  We have achieved stable psychophysical performance in mice in the laboratory, and collected data in which we use the instruments to evoke stimulation patterns.  We hypothesize that the brain regards as similar, for behavioral decisions, many different patterns that share similar statistical structure.  A third project is aimed at tracing the flow of information from one area to the next within the cerebral cortex to understand the circuits that underlie decoding.  We are labeling both anatomically and functionally neurons that project among several visual cortical areas.  By activating and inactivating these projections during behavior, we are measuring which projections are used in decision making.  A seminar with data from this project has been given in a cross-institute setting, and reports in abstract form are being prepared for conference presentation.","Adopted;Anatomy;Animals;Area;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral Assay;Biological Assay;Brain;Cell Count;Cells;Cerebral cortex;Data;Decision Making;Disease;Human;Individual;information processing;insight;Institutes;instrument;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Light;Link;Machine Learning;Mammals;Measures;Methods;Microscope;Mus;neuronal patterning;Neurons;new technology;Optics;Pattern;Perception;Performance;Population;Property;Psyche structure;Psychophysics;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;response;Schizophrenia;sensory stimulus;Structure;symposium;Training;two-photon;Visual;Visual Cortex;visual stimulus;Work;","PATTERNS OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY UNDERLYING BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS",n/a,"NIMH","9589763","","",1ZIAMH002956-02,1,ZIA,MH,002956,02,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14761208","HISTED, MARK ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,614217,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Mental Health;Neurosciences","In one project, we are developing models of spiking networks that relate neurons responses to circuit and cellular properties.  The theoretical work is being done in collaboration with Nicolas Brunel (Duke), and we are testing predictions in the laboratory using neurophysiology with silicon multi-site probes that allow recording many neurons across cortical layers simultaneously.  Some results have been submitted in abstract form for presentation (Sanzeni et al., Society for Neuroscience meeting, 2017) and are being elaborated into a manuscript (Sanzeni et al., in prep).  A manuscript with an early form of some of these results, obtained via simulation, has been submitted (Histed, under review).  This work is shedding light on what computations the cortex can perform, and what circuit properties like connection number and strengths, are needed to control those computations.In a second project, we are examining how the cortex controls the gain of responses by using a learning paradigm.  Animals and humans improve their performance in sensory tasks with practice.  But it is not known in general whether cortical representations become stronger (response gain increases) with practice, or whether downstream decoding becomes more effective.  To examine the neural basis of learning, we are training animals to perform controlled learning tasks and examining how neural responses change with learning.  We will adapt the models from project 1 to predict what circuit changes might lead to any response changes, and follow up that work with experimental tests of the predictions.  This work will explain how the brain, particularly the cerebral cortex, changes during learning to support improved behavior.  Understanding the circuit elements that change with learning is made possible by insights from theoretical work on networks that relates neural activity to circuit and anatomical features.","Affect;Anatomy;Animals;Area;base;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Brain region;Cells;Cerebral cortex;Collaborations;Data;Elements;follow-up;Human;improved;insight;Joints;Laboratories;Lead;Learning;Light;Manuscripts;Measures;meetings;Modeling;Mus;network models;Neurons;neurophysiology;Neurosciences;optogenetics;Output;Performance;Process;Property;Recurrence;relating to nervous system;response;Sensory;sensory cortex;sensory stimulus;Shapes;Silicon;simulation;Site;Societies;Sum;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;Testing;Theoretical model;Training;Visual;Visual Cortex;Work;","COMPUTATION BY RECURRENT CIRCUITS OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX",n/a,"NIMH","9589766","","",1ZIAMH002967-01,1,ZIA,MH,002967,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14761208","HISTED, MARK ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,614217,

In positron emission tomography (PET) studies, 11C-(R)-rolipram was used to visualize the activation of PDE4 by PKA. Because DISC1 is hypothesized to inhibit PDE4 activation, the absence of DISC1 would be expected to increase PDE4 activity. A recent study from our group used a Disc1 locus impairment (LI) mouse model to investigate whether 11C-(R)-rolipram PET imaging could quantify the interaction between PDE4 and DISC1. In vitro enzymatic assays in the brains of these animals were used to confirm changes in PDE4 activity observed via PET imaging.  We found that Disc1 LI mice showed a 41% significant increase in distribution volume (VT) compared to wild-type mice. VT/fP, which more accurately reflects 11C-(R)-rolipram binding than VT, showed a 73% significant increase in Disc1 LI compared to wild-type mice. We observed significant group differences in PDE4 enzyme activity; the activity levels of LI mice were greater than those of heterozygotes which, in turn, were greater than the activity levels of wild-type mice. Our findings demonstrate a clear increase in PDE4 activity in the absence of most critical Disc1 protein isoforms both in vivo and ex vivo. In addition, 11C-(R)-rolipram PET imaging was sensitive enough to assess differences in PDE4 activity caused by the interaction between PDE4 and DISC1. These data warrant further investigation into the potential biological activity of DISC1 isoforms.2. 18FOGA1 is a promising PET radioligand for measuring O-GlcNAcase in brain Strong evidence suggests that the accumulation and spread of misfolded, insoluble taua microtubule-associated protein that regulates axonal microtubule structure and function in neuronsplays an important role in the progression of Alzheimers disease. Inhibiting O-GlcNAcase  an enzyme that deglycosylates intracellular proteins including tau  is a key strategy for treating AD and related tauopathies. We developed a novel radioligand that binds to O-GlcNAcase: 18FOGA1. The ligand was synthesized and evaluated in rhesus monkey brain at baseline and after pretreatment with either thiamet-G, a potent O-GlcNAcase inhibitor, or the cold parent compound (self-blocking). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed and brain O-GlcNAcase knockout mice were also scanned to confirm specificity of the radioligand. We found that, in monkeys at baseline, brain uptake peaked around 5 SUV followed by slow washout. The highest uptake was observed in striatum followed by frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. After pretreatment with thiamet-G or cold parent, brain uptake was reduced to background levels in all regions; distribution volume (VT) decreases of > 90% were observed. Brain uptake of 18FOGA1 in wild-type mice at baseline was significantly higher than in O-GlcNAcase knockout mice. Pretreatment with thiamet-G reduced brain uptake in wild-type mice to the levels observed in O-GlcNAcase knockout mice; no further decreases were seen in the O-GlcNAcase knockout mice following pretreatment with thiamet-G. The effective dose for humans was estimated to be 21.8 mSv/MBq, which is well within the acceptable safety limits for 18F-labeled radioligands. Taken together, our results show that 18FOGA1 is a promising PET radioligand for measuring O-GlcNAcase in brain, and provides a potentially important tool for monitoring the treatment of tauopathies in Alzheimers disease. 3. Novel PET radioligands show that COX-1 is constitutively expressed and that COX-2 is induced by inflammation in rhesus macaque. The cyclooxygenase (COX) system is implicated in the pathophysiology of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and depression, and is a potential biomarker for neuroinflammation. The COX system comprises two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, which are key enzymes in neuroinflammation. We recently developed two PET radioligands: 11C-PS13 for COX-1 and 11C-MC1 for COX-2. Building on this work, a recent study from our laboratory explored the in vivo expression of COX-1 and COX-2 with the new radioligands in rhesus monkeys. The study was divided into two parts: whole-body PET/CT in normal monkeys and brain PET in monkeys with neuroinflammation. To induce transient neuroinflammation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was injected into the right putamen of monkeys. After intravenous injection of either radioligand into rhesus monkeys, dynamic whole-body or brain PET scans were obtained. To measure the specific uptake, we performed both baseline and blockade scans. As blockers, we used non-radioactive PS13, non-radioactive MC1, and aspirin, a preferential inhibitor of COX-1. We found that, under normal conditions, 11C-PS13 showed specific uptake in spleen, gastrointestinal tract, and brain while 11C-MC1 showed uptake only in brown adipose tissue. After putaminal injection of LPS, 11C-PS13 uptake was not increased in brain but 11C-MC1 uptake was significantly increased. Our results suggest that COX-1 is constitutively expressed in major organs while COX-2 is only induced by inflammation. Different patterns of expression between two COX isoforms were successfully demonstrated by 11C-PS13 and 11C-MC1, suggesting that these two radioligands show promise as biomarkers for measuring inflammation in various disorders, as well as target engagement of therapeutic drugs.","Alzheimer's Disease;Animals;Aspirin;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain imaging;Brown Fat;Cerebellum;Chemicals;Corpus striatum structure;Cyclic AMP;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;cyclooxygenase 1;cyclooxygenase 2;Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors;Data;DISC1 gene;Disease;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Ensure;enzyme activity;Enzymes;Evaluation;frontal lobe;Functional disorder;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Goals;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs;Heterozygote;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;human subject;Image;Impairment;improved;In Vitro;in vivo;Inflammation;inhibitor/antagonist;Injectable;Injection of therapeutic agent;intravenous injection;Investigation;Knockout Mice;Label;Laboratories;Ligands;Lipopolysaccharides;Macaca mulatta;Measurement;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Methods;Microtubule-Associated Proteins;Microtubules;molecular imaging;Monitor;Monkeys;Mood Disorders;mouse model;Mus;neuroinflammation;neuropsychiatric disorder;novel;Organ;Parents;Patients;Pattern;peptide O-linked N-acetylglucosamine-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;phosphoric diester hydrolase;Positron-Emission Tomography;potential biomarker;Procedures;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;putamen;Radiolabeled;radioligand;radiotracer;Reproducibility;Research;Role;Rolipram;Safety;Scanning;Schizophrenia;Second Messenger Systems;Specificity;Spleen;Structure;System;tau Proteins;Tauopathies;Testing;Thalamic structure;Therapeutic;tool;Tracer;uptake;Wild Type Mouse;Work;","TRANSLATIONAL EVALUATION OF PET RADIOTRACERS",n/a,"NIMH","9568256","","",1ZIAMH002795-16,1,ZIA,MH,002795,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8469041","INNIS, ROBERT ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1705345,

Building a database for brain 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO) imaged using 11CPBR28 in healthy subjectsTranslocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) has been widely imaged as a marker of neuroinflammation using several radioligands, including 11CPBR28. In order to study the effects of potential contributors to neuroinflammation (i.e., age, sex, obesity) and to determine whether 11CPBR28 binding can be accurately measured with fewer radio high-performance liquid chromatography (radioHPLC) measurements of arterial samples, we created an 11CPBR28 database of healthy subjects. 11CPBR28 scans from 48 healthy subjects (23 high-affinity binders (HABs) and 25 mixed-affinity binders (MABs), 20F/28M, age: 40.616.8 years) were analyzed using Logan plot with metabolite-corrected arterial input obtained from 23 arterial samples. Total distribution volume (VT) was found to be 1.2-fold higher in HABs across all brain regions. The polymorphism plot estimated nondisplaceable uptake (VND) as 1.40 mL  cm-3, which generated a specific-to-nondisplaceable ratio (BPND) of 1.60.6 in HABs and 1.10.6 in MABs. VT increased significantly with age in nearly all regions, but did not correlate with body mass index and was not affected by sex. VT was well estimated with radioHPLC measurements from six arterial samples. These results underscore which patient characteristics should be accounted for during 11CPBR28 studies and suggest ways to perform such studies more easily and with fewer blood samples. This work was performed under clinical protocols NCT01547780, NCT00526916, NCT01322555, NCT01851356, NCT02233868 and NCT00613119.2. Replication of the finding that PET radioligand binding to TSPO, a putative biomarker of inflammation, is increased during major depressive episodesTranslocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a potential biomarker of neuroinflammation, can be accurately quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and 11CPBR28, a TSPO tracer. A recent study found increased TSPO binding in multiple brain regions in unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) currently experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE). Building on this work, we sought to: 1) replicate these findings using a different patient population and a different tracer; 2) investigate the effects of antidepressants on TSPO binding in these subjects; and 3) determine the relationship of peripheral and central inflammatory markers to TSPO binding. Towards this end, unmedicated MDD subjects (n = 12), medicated MDD subjects (n = 16), and healthy controls (n = 20) underwent PET imaging using 11CPBR28. Total distribution volume (VT) was measured using arterial input function and corrected for TSPO genotype. The subgenual prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were chosen as regions of interest. Peripheral blood samples and cerebrospinal fluid were analyzed to investigate the relationship between peripheral and central inflammatory markers and TSPO binding. We found that TSPO binding was significantly higher in MDD versus healthy control subjects in the subgenual prefrontal cortex as well as the anterior cingulate cortex. Unmedicated MDD subjects had the highest level of TSPO binding, followed by medicated MDD subjects and healthy controls. TSPO binding correlated with interleukin-5 (IL-5) in cerebrospinal fluid, but with no other peripheral or central inflammatory markers. Taken together, our results replicated previous findings showing increased TSPO binding in the brain of MDD subjects experiencing an MDE, suggesting that inflammation is a key target for developing novel therapeutics to treat MDD. The findings are particularly important because they may help further elucidate pathways involved in the development of MDD as well as identify potential novel treatments and pharmacological targets. This work was performed under clinical protocol NCT01851356. 3. Cellular localization of the inflammatory biomarkers COX-1, COX-2, and TSPO in brain tissue samples from epileptic subjects.It is presently unclear what type of role neuroinflammation plays in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, animal models of epilepsy have shown increases in the inflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, and -2. COX-1 and -2 work by converting arachidonic acid into prostanoids. Which prostanoids are produced depend on the type of cell in which this pathway is expressed. Therefore, knowing the cellular expression of COX-1 and COX-2 is important for understanding their function. Only two studies have investigated the expression of COX-2 in epilepsy, but there are no reports on COX-1. To investigate this issue, we sought to measure the cellular expression of COX-1, COX-2, and 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in brain tissue samples from 33 people with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. TSPO, a biomarker of inflammation, was included as a positive control.We found that COX-1 is expressed in microglia, and COX-2 and TSPO are expressed in microglia and neurons. In-situ hybridization confirmed a higher expression of all three proteins in microglia than in astrocytes. The brain tissue could be classified into two groups based on histopathological assessment: sclerotic and non-sclerotic. No differences were found in the expression of any protein between the two groups. 	To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to measure the cellular expression of COX-1, COX-2, and TSPO amongst microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in surgical brain tissue samples drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Further research is needed to determine the effects of the COX inflammatory pathway in epilepsy.4. 11C-ER176, a radioligand for TSPO, can image all three afnity genotypes in human brain18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a key biomarker of neuroinammation. However, PET imaging of TSPO is complicated by the fact that most second-generation radioligands are sensitive to the single nucleotide polymorphism rs6971, though this is probably not the case for the prototypical agent 11C-PK11195. We recently found that 11C-ER176, a new analog of 11C-(R)-PK11195, showed little sensitivity to rs6971 when tested in vitro and had high specic binding in monkey brain. Building on this work, we sought to 1) determine whether the sensitivity of 11C-ER176 in humans was similar to the low sensitivity measured in vitro, and 2) measure the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND, or the ratio of specic-to-nondisplaceable uptake) of 11C-ER176 in human brain. Nine healthy volunteers3 high-afnity binders (HABs), 3 mixed-afnity binders (MABs), and 3 low-afnity binders (LABs)were studied with whole-body 11C-ER176 PET imaging. Eight separate healthy volunteers3 HABs, 3 MABs, and 2 LABsunderwent brain PET imaging. The 3 HABs underwent a repeat brain scan after TSPO blockade with XBD173. We found that regional standardized uptake values (SUVs) averaged from 60 to 120 minutes after injection in brain and peripheral organs with high TSPO densities such as lung and spleen were greater in HABs than in LABs. The whole-brain BPND for LABs was much lower than that for HABs but about the same as that for HABs with 11C-PBR28. Taken together, the results show that 11C-ER176 has obvious in vivo sensitivity to rs6971 that had not been expected from the in vitro studies with this agent. This suggests that the future development of any improved radioligand for TSPO should consider the possibility that in vitro properties will not be reected in vivo. We also found that 11C-ER176 has adequately high BPND for all rs6971 genotypes. Thus, this new radioligand is likely to have greater sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in patients. This work was performed under clinical protocols NCT02147392 and NCT02181582.","Affinity;Age;analog;Animal Model;Anterior;antidepressant effect;Arachidonic Acids;Astrocytes;base;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biological Markers;Blood specimen;Body mass index;Brain;Brain region;Brain scan;brain tissue;cell type;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Characteristics;Chemistry;cingulate cortex;Clinical Protocols;cyclooxygenase 1;cyclooxygenase 2;Databases;density;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Dose;Drug resistance;Enzymes;Epilepsy;experience;Functional disorder;Future;Generations;Genetic Polymorphism;Genotype;Goals;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Human;Image;improved;In Situ Hybridization;In Vitro;in vitro testing;in vivo;Inflammation;Inflammatory;inflammatory marker;Injection of therapeutic agent;interest;Interleukin-5;Label;Laboratories;Lung;Major Depressive Disorder;Measurement;Measures;Microglia;Monkeys;neuroinflammation;Neurons;novel;novel therapeutics;Obesity;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Pathway interactions;patient population;Patients;Peripheral;peripheral blood;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Play;Positron-Emission Tomography;potential biomarker;Prefrontal Cortex;Property;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;Prostaglandins;Proteins;Radio;Radioactive;Radiolabeled;radioligand;radiotracer;receptor;Reporting;Research;research clinical testing;Role;Sampling;Scanning;sex;single episode major depressive disorder;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Site;Spleen;Standardization;Techniques;Temporal Lobe Epilepsy;Tissue Sample;Tracer;Travel;uptake;Work;","CLINICAL EVALUATION OF PET RADIOTRACERS",n/a,"NIMH","9568263","","",1ZIAMH002852-13,1,ZIA,MH,002852,13,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8469041","INNIS, ROBERT ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2558017,
"Biotechnology;Genetics;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Although once highly controversial, it is now well-accepted that there exists a diverse population of mRNAs and non-coding microRNAs in the distal structural/functional domains of the neuron which include the dendrite, axon, and presynaptic nerve terminal.  It has also become well-established that proteins synthesized from these mRNA templates play a key role in the development and long-term viability of the axon.  The findings derived from this new area of research have recently been reviewed (Scott et al., 2015).In regard to this past years research activities, members of the Section were committed to the conduct of three independent  projects. The progress effected in each of these projects is summarized, briefly, below: Project #1. Nuclear-encoded Mitochondrial mRNAs Present in the Axon.This past year, the components of the axonal nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs were delineated using a microarray analysis. This experiment was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Abdel Elkahoun, Director of the Microarray Core Facility (NHGRI). Results of this experiment were surprising, indicating that there were approximately 130 different nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs present in the axon (Aschrafi et al., 2016).  Interestingly, the levels of several of these mRNAs far exceeded their corresponding levels in their parental cell bodies.  This observation raises the possibility that some of these mRNAs were being selectively transported to this distal structural/functional domain of the neuron. . The local translation of two of these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs was found to play a key role in the regulation of local energy metabolism, modulating the synthesis of ATP and ultimately the production of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS)(reviewed in Scott et al., 2015).  Dysregulation of the local translation of this mRNA resulted in reductions in the levels of ATP in the axon and an elevation in the production of ROS, two factors which negatively affected the growth and health of the axon (for review, see Gale et al., 2017).The protein constituents of the axonal trafficking granule associated with Cytochrome c-oxidase (Cox IV) mRNA, a messenger that codes for a key component of the oxidative phosphorylation chain, have been identified by a combination of RNA-affinity purification and mass spectroscopy.Surprisingly, there are approximately 50-60 different proteins that associate with the RNA sequences that regulate the transport of this mRNA to the axon (i.e., zipcode), a finding that suggests that the zipcode serves as a nucleation site for the formation of an RNA-protein trafficking complex (Kar et al., 2017).Project # 2. MicroRNAs present in the axonPreviously, we had reported, that in addition to a highly diverse population of mRNAs, that the axon contained over 100 different small, noncoding RNAs (for review, see Kaplan et al., 2013).  One of these miRNAs, miRNA338, was found to coordinately regulate the local expression of several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs that coded for key components of the oxidative phosphorylation chain and regulated local energy metabolism ( e,g., Cytochrome-c oxidase IV and ATP synthase mRNAs).  Members of our international collaborative research team have found that miRNA338 also regulates the expression of several axon guidance genes that markedly effect the migration and differentiation of cortical neurons during development.  Interestingly, the precursor of the mature, functional form of miRNA 338 was observed to be associated with the organelle, itself. This finding suggested that this precursor miRNA was bound to the mitochondria and served as a reservoir in the activity-dependent activation of the mature miRNA 338 (Vargas et al., 2016).  The results of affinity purification and mass spectroscopy experiments indicated that the precursor miRNA338 associated with a large number of proteins that regulated its transport to the axon, as well as its binding to the mitochondria (Vargas et al., 2016).  The results of gene ontology analysis indicated that these proteins  included mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and axonal motor proteins, as well as a number of well-known RNA-binding proteins.Project #3. Local Regulation of Neurotransmitter Synthesis.This year members of the laboratory reported that mRNAs encoding the enzymes that comprise the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway were present in the axon and were being actively translated locally in sympathetic neurons (Gervasi et al., 2016; Aschrafi et al., 2017).  The introduction of the mRNA encoding tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine biosynthesis, directly into the axon, by transfection, markedly increased the synthesis of the catecholamine neurotransmitters, dopamine and norepinephrine.  Stimulation of these sympathetic neurons resulted in significant increases in the release of these two neurotransmitters into the cell culture media (Aschrafi et al., 2017).","3' Untranslated Regions;Address;Affinity Chromatography;Anabolism;Animals;Area;ATP Synthesis Pathway;Axon;axon guidance;Behavior;Behavioral;Binding;Brain;Catecholamines;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;clinically relevant;Code;Collaborations;Complex;Consensus;Core Facility;Culture Media;cytochrome c oxidase;Cytoplasmic Granules;Dendrites;Development;Distal;Dopamine;Energy Metabolism;Enzymes;experimental study;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Translation;Goals;Growth;Growth and Development function;Health;In Vitro;International;Investigation;Laboratories;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;member;Mental disorders;Messenger RNA;Microarray Analysis;MicroRNAs;migration;Mitochondria;mitochondrial messenger RNA;Molecular;Motor;National Human Genome Research Institute;negative affect;Nerve;Neurobiology;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Norepinephrine;Nuclear;Ontology;Organelles;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Physiological;Play;Population;Population Heterogeneity;presynaptic neurons;Production;programs;Protein Biosynthesis;protein transport;Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Research Activity;reuptake;Ribonucleoproteins;RNA;RNA Sequences;RNA-Binding Proteins;Role;Site;System;trafficking;Transfection;Translating;Translations;Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase;Untranslated RNA;","SUBCELLULAR COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF NEURONAL GENE EXPRESSION",n/a,"NIMH","9568250","","",1ZIAMH002768-20,1,ZIA,MH,002768,20,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9694573","KAPLAN, BARRY ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1768562,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Genetics;Mental Health;Neurosciences","In starting a new unit, we have been building infrastructure, designing and conducting our experiments, and collecting preliminary data. First, to achieve mechanistic understanding of the functional connectivity among different cortical areas, we have started systematically examining the synaptic strength from different brain areas to diverse neuronal types in the primary somatosensory cortex, using electrophysiological methods combined with genetic tools. Second, to identify distinct microcircuits recruited by these different long-range inputs, we have been setting up imaging methods to monitor and manipulate activity of specific neuronal populations. Third, to understand the behavioral relevance of these circuits, we have been designing different types of behavior tasks that allow us to understand the role of these circuits in animals behaviors.  The current hypothesis in our lab is that long-range projections from higher-order cortical and neuromodulatory areas recruit specific subtypes of GABAergic neurons in sensory cortex. As a key mediator, this distinct set of GABAergic neurons engage a specific local microcircuit.","Animal Behavior;Animals;Area;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Models;Brain;cell type;Cerebral cortex;Cognition;Communication;Communication impairment;Complex;Cues;Data;design;Development;Electrophysiology (science);Environment;Esthesia;experience;experimental study;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Genetic;Genetic Techniques;Goals;Image;imaging modality;interdisciplinary approach;Lead;Mediator of activation protein;Memory;Mental disorders;Methods;Minority;Molecular Genetics;Monitor;Movement;Neurons;neuroregulation;optogenetics;Perception;Pharmacogenetics;Population;Process;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Infrastructure;Rodent;Role;sensorimotor system;Sensory;sensory cortex;Somatosensory Cortex;Specificity;Stream;Synapses;System;tool;Vibrissae;Viral;","CIRCUIT MECHANISMS UNDERLYING CORTICAL COMMUNICATIONS",n/a,"NIMH","9568287","","",1ZIAMH002959-01,1,ZIA,MH,002959,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15226860","LEE, SOOHYUN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1232308,
"Behavioral and Social Science;Bipolar Disorder;Brain Disorders;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Serious Mental Illness","Since the beginning of this project we have screened over 3000 subjects for this study. We have enrolled approximately 215 youth with bipolar disorder (BD), 320 subjects at risk for BD because they have a parent or sibling with the illness, and 120 adults with BD. This year, approximately 15 new subjects were enrolled.This year we continued our work designed to identify the brain mechanisms underlying BD in children; compare brain function in youth and adults with BD in order to begin to understand how the illness develops over time; and compare brain function in youth at familial risk for BD to those with BD and those at low risk, in order to facilitate the eventual development of preventive interventions.Regarding our work on the brain mechanisms mediating BD, much of that work consists of, not only comparing youth with BD to healthy youth, but also comparing youth with BD to those with severe, chronic irritability (the so-called Disruptive Mood Dysregulation, or DMDD, population, see Annual Intramural Research Report ZIAMH002786). It is important to compare youth with BD and those with DMDD because, particularly before the inclusion of DMDD in the DSM-5, irritable children frequently received the diagnosis of BD in the community, despite not having a history of manic episodes. This potential misdiagnosis is important because, compared to severe, chronic irritability, BD in youth is treated with medications with high side-effect burden.  While it is possible that the addition of DMDD to DSM-5 has decreased the extent to which irritable children are misdiagnosed as having BD, nonetheless it is important to differentiate the brain mechanisms underlying each of these clinical presentations, because differences between the diagnoses may be relevant to treatment approaches. Across our bipolar disorder-related groups (adults with BD, youth with BD, youth at risk for BD), face emotion processing has been a major focus of our work. This is because deficits labeling face emotions accurately, as well as deficits in face emotion memory, are present, not only in patients with BD, but also in youth at risk for the disorder. These findings indicate that such deficits in face emotion labeling and memory are potential endophenotypes for BD. Last year we published a paper demonstrating that, when youth with BD and DMDD labeled emotional faces,  the neural mechanisms associated with irritability differed across diagnoses. This year, we conducted a study whose results are currently being analyzed.  This study was designed to replicate the prior work, while also studying eye tracking patterns across the groups. Specifically, subjects complete the face emotion labeling paradigm in the scanner one day, and the next day complete it while doing eye tracking.  In previously published work, we found that youth with BD, and those at risk for the illness, had a decreased tendency to focus on the eye region while labeling emotional faces.  Results for the DMDD group were equivocal. Our goal is to replicate both our previous imaging and eye tracking findings; to examine potential associations between eye tracking patterns and neural activity; and to determine whether youth with DMDD have an eye tracking deficit. Our research on pediatric bipolar disorder has been productive.  Our accomplishments include demonstrating that severe, chronic irritability is not a pediatric presentation of BD, but that youth with BD, like adults with the illness, experience definable episodes of mania. We identified face emotion labeling and increased variability in reaction time as potential heritable biomarkers of BD, and explored the brain mechanisms mediating each. However, we have decided to terminate this project and devote all of our resources to the study of chronic irritability in youth (see Annual Report ZIAMH002786). The reasons for this are multiple, including the fact that irritability is significantly more common in youth than is BD; there is a marked paucity of research on irritability; and there are very few evidence-based treatments for irritability.","Adolescent;Adult;Adverse effects;Amish;Annual Reports;Attention;Base of the Brain;behavior test;Behavioral Paradigm;Biological Markers;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Child;Childhood;childhood bipolar disorder;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Markers;Communities;design;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;disorder risk;DNA Sequence Alteration;DSM-V;Emotional;emotional stimulus;Emotions;endophenotype;Enrollment;Evidence based treatment;experience;Eye;Face;Family;First Degree Relative;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Genetic Materials;Goals;Heritability;Image;Impairment;indexing;interest;Intramural Research;Label;longitudinal course;Manic;Mediating;Memory;Moods;Mutation;neural circuit;Neurocognitive;neuromechanism;neurophysiology;outcome forecast;Paper;Parents;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;phenomenological models;Population;prevent;Preventive Intervention;Process;Protocols documentation;psychologic;Public Health;Publishing;Punishment;Reaction Time;Recording of previous events;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;Resources;response;Rewards;Risk;Running;Siblings;Standardization;Study Subject;Symptoms;Testing;therapy development;Time;treatment response;Work;Youth;","THE PHENOMENOLOGY AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF JUVENILE BIPOLAR DISORDER",n/a,"NIMH","9568251","","",1ZIAMH002778-18,1,ZIA,MH,002778,18,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6482402","LEIBENLUFT, ELLEN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,545617,
"Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD);Behavioral and Social Science;Bipolar Disorder;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities;Depression;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Serious Mental Illness","Given concerns about the appropriate diagnosis for children with chronic, severe irritability, we defined the syndrome of severe mood dysregulation(SMD)to capture youth with extremely severe irritability and symptoms of hyperarousal. Our SMD phenotype formed the basis for the new pediatric diagnosis of mood dysregulation disorder with dysphoria(DMDD)in DSM-5. Since the inception of this project, approximately 350 youth with SMD/DMDD have been recruited into the project. Approximately 40 new patients were recruited this year. The youth with DMDD that we study suffer very severe psychiatric impairment, as assessed by medications received, number of psychiatric hospitalizations, and standardized measures of function. As noted above, we demonstrated differences between youth with SMD and those with bipolar disorder (BD) in clinical course, family history, and brain mechanisms associated with symptoms. In the course of this work, we became increasingly interested in the pathophysiology of irritability, not just in comparison to that of BD, but also in its own right.  This is because irritability is one of the most common, impairing psychiatric symptoms in children, but there has been little research devoted to it, and there are remarkably few evidence-based treatments. This year, we published a translational mechanistic model of irritability that suggests that core deficits in pediatric irritability include aberrant responses to frustration, aberrant approach responses to threat, and deficits in instrumental learning that prevent them from adapting appropriately to changes in environmental contingencies. The construct of irritability is particularly well-suited for the transdiagnostic, translational approach of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Much of our work now involves examining irritability, not only in DMDD, but also in other groups exhibiting irritability, including youth with anxiety disorders or ADHD. With the arrival of a new Unit in our Branch focused on adolescent depression, we will include such youth also in our studies. (Also, as explained under MH002778-18, in the upcoming year will discontinue our work with youth with bipolar disorder.) Across groups, we characterize irritability as a continuous variable. A focus of our neuroimaging work includes the use of frustrating tasks, since a hallmark of irritability is difficulty tolerating frustration. Previously, we demonstrated behavioral and neural differences between irritable and non-irritable youth during a frustrating attentional task. We improved that paradigm and obtained fMRI data from approximately 200 youth with DMDD, ADHD, and/or anxiety disorders, as well as healthy youth. Our results show that irritability is associated with increased prefrontal and striatal engagement when youth attempt an attention orienting task after receiving frustrating feedback. Since prefrontal engagement is important in emotion regulation, one interpretation of this finding is that such prefrontal emotion regulation mechanisms are less efficient in irritable than non-irritable youth.  Alternatively, in irritable youth, increased prefrontal engagement may be required after frustration to down-regulate exaggerated subcortical limbic responses e.g., in the striatum. These effects of irritability are present even when the effects of ADHD and anxiety are taken into account. We have also piloted two  additional frustration tasks. The second frustration task differs from the one described above in the timing of frustration (short blocks of frustration, occurring in randomized order with non-frustrating blocks, vs. a long block of non-frustration followed by a long bout of frustration) and in the task involved (attention orienting in the first task, cognitive flexibility in the second). The development of this second task thus allows us to test whether, across task timing differences and cognitive tasks, increased irritability is associated with increased prefrontal engagement after frustration. Our third frustration task will allow us to determine whether irritability is associated with instrumental learning deficits at baseline and after frustration.  Instrumental learning is the process by which people learn which of their behaviors will be rewarded. Deficits in such learning could lead to increased frustration in irritable youth.  Children typically present with multiple symptoms and diagnoses. It is important to identify pathophysiological mechanisms that are specific to different symptoms, and also how the neural mechanisms mediating different symptoms interact. Such research is important to further efforts toward personalized medicine.  We are particularly interested in neural mechanisms that differentiate anxiety and irritability, given cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between these traits and possible shared circuitry mediating them. Both irritable and anxious youth have an attention bias toward threatening faces.  Therefore, we scanned approximately 200 children with a range of common symptoms, including anxiety, irritability, and ADHD, while they completed an attention bias task.  We found that irritability is associated with increased amygdala, striatal, and prefrontal engagement when subjects were asked to attend away from threat. In contrast, anxiety was associated with normal neural activity but abnormal connectivity between prefrontal and limbic regions. A major focus of our work is treatment. We continue our double-blind trial designed to ascertain whether citalopram (a serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressant that is effective in the treatment of pediatric anxiety) plus stimulant is more effective than placebo plus stimulant in the treatment of severe irritability. Stimulant and SRI treatment tend to have fewer side-effects than atypical antipsychotic treatment, which is considered first-line treatment for BD, yet stimulants and SRI's are relatively contraindicated in patients with BD because of concern about possibly inducing a manic episode. Therefore, this work has considerable public health importance. We have randomized approximately 55 children into the trial, and youth are tolerating the treatment well. We are now developing and testing two novel psychosocial approaches to treating irritability. The first involves computer-based training designed to shift a subject's perception of ambiguous faces from angry toward happy. In work published last year, we found that youth with DMDD tend to judge ambiguous faces as angry rather than happy; that we can change this judgment with computer-based training; and that this is associated with decreased irritability. This was an open trial, without a control condition. We have begun a controlled trial of this new Interpretation Bias Treatment, along with brain imaging before and after training. Recruitment has been robust, and approximately 25 youth have completed the trial. Youth complete neuroimaging on a task assessing interpretation bias pre and post treatment. We are also now completing an open pilot study of a manual-based cognitive behavioral treatment targeting irritability. This treatment has a strong emphasis on behavioral techniques i.e., exposing the child to tolerable, but frustrating situations, to improve the child's ability to tolerate such situations. The treatment is based on our neuroscience-based model of irritability, including irritable children's hypothesized deficits in the process and content of instrumental learning, and their aberrant responses to frustration.  We will soon begin a multiple baseline design study of this new treatment, since such a design more structured piloting whose results can be subjected to statistical analysis.  Imaging on the first frustration paradigm, described above, will be conducted pre and post treatment.","Adopted;Adverse effects;Aftercare;Age;Amygdaloid structure;Anger;Antidepressive Agents;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;anxious;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;attentional bias;atypical antipsychotic;base;Behavior;Behavioral;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Brain imaging;Child;child depression;Child Psychiatry;Childhood;childhood anxiety;Chronic;Citalopram;Clinical;Cognitive;cognitive task;Cognitive Therapy;common symptom;common treatment;control trial;Corpus striatum structure;Data;design;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Dimensions;Disease;Double-blind trial;DSM-V;dysphoria;E-learning;emotion regulation;Evidence based treatment;Exhibits;experience;Face;Family;Feedback;flexibility;Fostering;Frustration;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Hospitalization;Image;Impairment;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;Intervention;Judgment;Lead;Learning;Longitudinal Studies;Manic;Manuals;Mediating;Modeling;Moods;National Institute of Mental Health;neuroimaging;neuromechanism;Neurosciences;novel;Operant Conditioning;Patients;Perception;personalized medicine;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Placebos;Population;prevent;Process;Protocols documentation;prototype;psychiatric symptom;psychosocial;Public Health;Publishing;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;relating to nervous system;Research;Research Design;Research Domain Criteria;Research Personnel;response;reuptake;Rewards;Risk;Scanning;severe mood dysregulation;standardize measure;Statistical Data Interpretation;Structure;Sum;Symptoms;Syndrome;Techniques;Testing;Time;Training;trait;translational approach;treatment response;trial design;Unipolar Depression;Work;Youth;","THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND TREATMENT OF CHILDREN WITH SEVERE IRRITABILITY",n/a,"NIMH","9568255","","",1ZIAMH002786-16,1,ZIA,MH,002786,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6482402","LEIBENLUFT, ELLEN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,3351647,
"Biomedical Imaging;Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Mental Health;Neurosciences","To understand our vision, it is critical to place humans within an appropriate phylogentic context: humans are primates, and their dominant use of vision is typical of primates and different from other mammals.  As a sensing faculty, vision places individuals at a great advantage over their environment, allowing them to remotely sense complex details from a safe distance.  As this context is critical for our research, we recently published a comprehensive review describing the distinguishing features of primate vision against a mammalian background, and thus placing human vision into its proper evolutionary context (Leopold, Freiwald, and Mitchell, Evolution of Nervous Systems, ed. Kaas, 2017). Much of our research on visual perception centers on how we see shapes, objects, and scenes. From the moment light enters the eyes, our percept is molded by a series of processing stages, crafted through years of visual experience during primates unusually long period of development. In our laboratory, we combine fMRI and electrophysiology to ask questions such as, how does the brain create a three-dimensional representation of the world, given that its retinal images are inherently two-dimensional? How do we complete surfaces, distinguish between foreground and background, and understand the difference between real motion and the motion caused by our own eye movements? These types of questions are present in each of our research lines. Here we described several studies that focus on particular sub-questions. In the past two years, we have placed most of our emphasis studying visual perception on the mysterious role of the large pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, which projects to multiple visual areas including the primary visual cortex (V1).  In one set of studies, we have been investigating electrical activity across the pulvinar using a novel electrode mapping approach.  This large project has yielded two papers currently in preparation (Murphy et al. and (Deng et al..  We have recently published a comprehensive review paper on the pulvinar, (Bridge et al., 2016), which focuses on multiple aspects of its structure and function, including a newly hypothesized transient visual pathway that precedes that adult geniculostriate pathway that conveys early postnatal visual information.  We have recently submitted a large collaborative study investigating the role of early-life ablation of one small pulvinar nucleus, and the effect of its disruption on visually-guided manual behavior in the adult (Mundinano et al., 2017), under review. We have also made progress on activity in the visual cortex, focusing on several features of area V1. In one study, currently under review (Cox et al., 2017)), we have studied the effects of a brief attentional cue on activity outside neurons receptive fields within V1, with the results suggesting that there is effectively an activity blink just following the presentation of meaningful cues.  We further investigated the entrainment of spiking and gamma-range LFP activity by alpha signals (Dougherty et al., 2017). We also published a paper showing that the ablation of are V1 does not disrupt but rather enhances activity correlation in higher-order visual areas (Shapcott et al.,  2016). Finally, in a collaborative study, we found that human patients with damage to the parietal cortex were selectively affected in their perception of binocular disparity (Murphy et al., 2016).In our work on visual perception, we have been increasingly interested in the brains responses to stimuli that are not simply flashed on the screen but that rather evolve over time.  To this end, we have conducted multiple studies in which macaques and marmosets freely view dynamic video stimuli. From an experimental perspective, data analysis from this type of experiment can be challenging, as there is inherent variability in the subjects eye positions.  In one study, we systematically examined the regional fMRI responses to the subjects eye movements, and compared them to the fMRI responses to the events in the movie itself (Russ et al., 2016).  We found that the activity patterns under these two conditions were very different.  In a very recent study, we used both fMRI and electrophysiology to create a new means to classify neural responses using fMRI maps (Park et al., 2017).  This method demonstrated that neurons within hundreds of microns of one another were affiliated in very different ways with distant brain areas.

"Biomedical Imaging;Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Mental Health;Neurosciences","To understand our vision, it is critical to place humans within an appropriate phylogentic context: humans are primates, and their dominant use of vision is typical of primates and different from other mammals.  As a sensing faculty, vision places individuals at a great advantage over their environment, allowing them to remotely sense complex details from a safe distance.  As this context is critical for our research, we recently published a comprehensive review describing the distinguishing features of primate vision against a mammalian background, and thus placing human vision into its proper evolutionary context (Leopold, Freiwald, and Mitchell, Evolution of Nervous Systems, ed. Kaas, 2017). Much of our research on visual perception centers on how we see shapes, objects, and scenes. From the moment light enters the eyes, our percept is molded by a series of processing stages, crafted through years of visual experience during primates unusually long period of development. In our laboratory, we combine fMRI and electrophysiology to ask questions such as, how does the brain create a three-dimensional representation of the world, given that its retinal images are inherently two-dimensional? How do we complete surfaces, distinguish between foreground and background, and understand the difference between real motion and the motion caused by our own eye movements? These types of questions are present in each of our research lines. Here we described several studies that focus on particular sub-questions. In the past two years, we have placed most of our emphasis studying visual perception on the mysterious role of the large pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, which projects to multiple visual areas including the primary visual cortex (V1).  In one set of studies, we have been investigating electrical activity across the pulvinar using a novel electrode mapping approach.  This large project has yielded two papers currently in preparation (Murphy et al. and (Deng et al..  We have recently published a comprehensive review paper on the pulvinar, (Bridge et al., 2016), which focuses on multiple aspects of its structure and function, including a newly hypothesized transient visual pathway that precedes that adult geniculostriate pathway that conveys early postnatal visual information.  We have recently submitted a large collaborative study investigating the role of early-life ablation of one small pulvinar nucleus, and the effect of its disruption on visually-guided manual behavior in the adult (Mundinano et al., 2017), under review. We have also made progress on activity in the visual cortex, focusing on several features of area V1. In one study, currently under review (Cox et al., 2017)), we have studied the effects of a brief attentional cue on activity outside neurons receptive fields within V1, with the results suggesting that there is effectively an activity blink just following the presentation of meaningful cues.  We further investigated the entrainment of spiking and gamma-range LFP activity by alpha signals (Dougherty et al., 2017). We also published a paper showing that the ablation of are V1 does not disrupt but rather enhances activity correlation in higher-order visual areas (Shapcott et al.,  2016). Finally, in a collaborative study, we found that human patients with damage to the parietal cortex were selectively affected in their perception of binocular disparity (Murphy et al., 2016).In our work on visual perception, we have been increasingly interested in the brains responses to stimuli that are not simply flashed on the screen but that rather evolve over time.  To this end, we have conducted multiple studies in which macaques and marmosets freely view dynamic video stimuli. From an experimental perspective, data analysis from this type of experiment can be challenging, as there is inherent variability in the subjects eye positions.  In one study, we systematically examined the regional fMRI responses to the subjects eye movements, and compared them to the fMRI responses to the events in the movie itself (Russ et al., 2016).  We found that the activity patterns under these two conditions were very different.  In a very recent study, we used both fMRI and electrophysiology to create a new means to classify neural responses using fMRI maps (Park et al., 2017).  This method demonstrated that neurons within hundreds of microns of one another were affiliated in very different ways with distant brain areas.

"Biomedical Imaging;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Nearly everybody has seen maps of brain activity generated by functional MRI (fMRI).  This method, which at its core measures blood flow-based magnetic effects on water molecules, allows researchers to map out areas of the brain based on sensory responses, motor actions, and even complex cognitive thoughts.  It has, for the first time, allowed for a routine interrogation and precise localization of human brain activity during cognitive tasks.  The success of fMRI in unveiling new and important properties of human brain function is undebatable, and the resulting images have had the consequence of informing the public about the brains circuits and raising interest in neuroscience more generally. Always lurking in the background, however, has been the simple fact that fMRI does not measure neural activity but only regional blood flow, whichto the extent that it is consistently coupled with neural activitycan act as a surrogate or marker for underlying electrical signals.One of the long-term goals in our laboratory is to understand the vexing relationship between hemodynamic fMRI activity and electrical neural activity.  Optimistic views of this problem in the past have considered this relationship as possibly being a straightforward conversion: When given an fMRI response pattern, is there a well-defined measure of electrical activity that corresponds to it?  Unfortunately, much evidence suggests that this simple translation cannot be valid, since the local coupling between blood flow and neurons is highly dependent on stimuli, contexts, and behavioral states.  Moreover, given the mismatch in the dimensionality of the signals (there are roughly one million cells in a single fMRI voxel), the prospect of any one-to-one mapping seems fruitless.  Nonetheless, there is much to be learned about the relationship of neurons, their various forms of electrical responses, and the local control of blood flow that indicates activity in the fMRI scanner.  In the laboratory, we have focused on targeted and practical questions, leaving more specific neurovascular coupling questions (such as how neural firing leads to the local perfusion of capillaries) to other laboratories.  Our studies focus on two points: first, the diversity of neural spiking activity within a single voxel, and second, the relationship of large-scale functional MRI networks to local and remote neural activity in the brain.In one project, we discovered that neurons from within a single voxel were highly varied in their responses to naturalistic movies.  Important from the perspective of the basis of the fMRI signal, we further found the local blood flow activity followed only a small proportion (16%) of 150 neurons tightly packed within a single voxel &lt; 1mm3 (Park et al., Neuron 2017). The time courses of these special neurons closely matched both the local field potential (LFP) signal and the vascular response, suggesting that they may have a particular importance for local vascular control.  This result may help explain why there is often a discrepancy between local spiking activity on the one hand and LFP and fMRI activity on the other, a point we have previously made in the laboratory (Maier et al.  Nature Neuroscience 2008).  In another collaborative paper published this year, we similarly found fMRI activity that, although robust, seemed a mismatch compared to previously single-unit results from corresponding brain areas (Kaskan et al., 2017).  These findings, while challenging for simple interpretations, gradually shape our understanding of how to interpret fMRI results.Using a rather different approach, we have undertaken several studies to explore the manner in which brain arousal is expressed, both in its electrical and fMRI responses, and also controlled by arousal structures such as the basal forebrain.  Last April  we published findings from our investigation of the manner in which brain arousal is simultaneously reflected in behavioral, electrophysiological, and fMRI measures (Chang et al., 2016). Specifically, we found that behavioral changes in arousal, matched by corresponding changes in the cortical field potentials, were yoked to hemodynamic fluctuations in an identified multicomponent network, or template, that could be used to read out the arousal state of an animal at each point in time. This study has important implications for the enormous number of human fMRI studies of functional connectivity, which attempt to quantify the functional relationship between areas based on the correlation of their signals. In a subsequent study employing a more causal manipulation, we have examined the effects of reversibly inactivating the basal forebrain using pharmacological agents (Turchi, Chang, et al., , in preparation). The basal forebrain is a small region that is the origin of many long-range anatomical projections that reach virtually the entire cerebral cortex. Our initial experiments, inactivating portions of this structure in animals undergoing fMRI testing, suggest that the basal forebrain is centrally involved in regulating spontaneous signals throughout the telencephalon. Its effect is particularly pronounced during transitions of arousal, gauged by eye opening and closure. Finally, through collaboration (Liu X et al., manuscript under review), we have also found evidence that the basal forebrain orchestrates important aspects of arousal fluctuations in the human brain.  Together, these studies paint a new picture of spontaneous brain activity that consists of two rather different components:  the first global component is orchestrated regionally by the basal forebrain long-range projections, whereas the second local component is more strongly determined by other factors, including but not limited to anatomical projections.","Anatomy;Animals;Area;Arousal;awake;basal forebrain;base;Base of the Brain;Basic Science;Behavioral;Blood capillaries;Blood flow;Blood Vessels;Brain;Brain imaging;capillary;Cells;Cerebral cortex;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive task;Collaborations;Complex;Coupled;Coupling;Dimensions;Electrophysiology (science);experimental study;Eye;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;functional MRI scan;Goals;Head;hemodynamics;Human;Hydrogen;Image;interest;Investigation;Laboratories;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetism;Manuscripts;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Medicine;Methods;Monitor;Motor;movie;Nature;Neurons;Neurosciences;Neurosciences Research;neurovascular coupling;Paint;Paper;Patients;Pattern;peer;Perfusion;Pharmacology;Preparation;programs;Property;Publishing;Regional Blood Flow;Regulation;relating to nervous system;Research;Research Methodology;Research Personnel;response;Rest;Scanning;Sensory;Shapes;Signal Transduction;soft tissue;Stimulus;Structure;success;Telencephalon;Testing;Thinking;Time;tool;Translations;Variant;virtual;Wakefulness;Water;Work;","THE NEURAL BASIS OF FUNCTIONAL MRI RESPONSES",n/a,"NIMH","9568271","","",1ZIAMH002896-11,1,ZIA,MH,002896,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8014338","LEOPOLD, DAVID A",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NINDS,,,87595,

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Neuroscientists studying the brain use stimuli with different levels of complexity to study the neural mechanism of sight.  These stimuli range from dots and lines, to faces and bodies.  Decades of investigation using electrophysiological and functional imaging methods have revealed that the brains of humans and animals are replete with neurons that respond selectively to particular visual features.  These favored features are of many types, with brain areas organized in an apparent cascade of simpler features identified early in the pipeline, and more complex ones identified later.  Selectively responding neurons are often said to represent individual visual features. The normal interplay between primates does not much resemble the contrived and controlled experiments that have given rise to our theories about brain function. A logical question, then, is whether a neuron that represents a feature, say a face, in one context will also represent that face in a different context. Humans are a particularly large primate species, but are typical of primates in some ways, such as the abundant use of vision to mediate interaction with others.  The primate brain has a significant fraction of its billions of neurons dedicated to the processing of social stimuli. An exciting challenge for neuroscientists is to understand how the neural representation of stimuli gleaned from conventional testing paradigms bears on perception and behavior under more natural conditions.  Over the past year, we have used extensively a microwire bundle array developed and modified in the laboratory to longitudinally track the activity of cells in the brain that reside in so-called face patches, which are small, circumscribed regions showing greater fMRI responses to faces than to other categories of stimuli.  We recently investigated fMRI responses in the face patches of both macaques (Russ et al.,2015) and marmosets (Hung et al., 2015).  Within the last year, we have continued this line of research in both species, with new results published in the macaque.In one free-viewing study in the macaque, we tracked the relative contribution of motion caused by the subjects own eye movements to the fMRI signals in the brain (Russ et al., 2016).  In this study, we showed that the brain areas responding to the motion in a movie video were very different than those responsive to an animals own eye movements.  In another study (Park et al., 2017) which is a follow up to a previous electrophysiology study (McMahon et al., 2015), we developed a new method for understanding the surprising functional diversity of neurons within &lt;1mm3 area in the cerebral cortex.  That study tracked the time course of both neuron activity and fMRI activity in monkeys watching 5-minute movies.  By comparing the time courses of voxels throughout the brain to each neurons response, we obtained whole-brain activity maps for each neuron.  This method then allowed us to classify neurons based on their affiliation with other areas throughout the brain. Multiple other studies are underway in the laboratory, in both macaques and marmosets.  In the macaques, for example, we are presently preparing a manuscript that describes the way in which neurons in face patches respond to the facial identity of monkey and human faces (Koyano et al., in preparation).  This study is in many ways a follow up to a study published more than a decade ago (Leopold et al.,  2006), and is closely related to recent work published by Doris Tsao and colleagues.  This work highlights the important role of the average face, which serves as a learned norm to steer the brains perception of individual identity.   In the marmoset, we are setting up to investigate the developmental plasticity of face identity learning, using a combination of microelectrode and optical imaging methods. A common theme in these projects is an ethological and evolutionary perspective as they shape theories of brain function.  To that end, in the last year we have published three reviews and commentaries on the topic of social neuroscience and evolution.  One of these, published in Jon Kaass 4-volume set Evolution of Nervous Systems, focuses on the evolution of high-level visual specialization in primates (Leopold et al., 2017).   Another is a discussion of the use of marmosets as a model to study issues in social neuroscience (Miller et al., Neuron, 2016).

"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Mental Health;Neurosciences","There are multiple uses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the study of nonhuman primate neuroscience, each of which aims to make the research as precise and efficient, and as relevant to humans, as possible.  The NIF facility at the NIH strives to make both structural and functional imaging feasible and fluid for any laboratories on the NIH campus interested in applying these methods.  We offer high resolution anatomical scans, diffusion imaging, as well as comprehensive functional imaging.  With the latter comes a step-by-step program to help scientists gain autonomy in conducting their functional MRI experiments, which are often difficult and most fruitful when combined with other methods. At the heart of the facilitys operation is functional MRI (fMRI), which allows researchers to visualize activity patterns within the brain, often mapping the responses for one type of sensory stimulus relative to that for another.  This straightforward type of mapping, which is routine in humans, is also routine in nonhuman primates as long as the experimental components and infrastructure are in place. A large number of steps lie between the acquisition of raw MR signals and the interpretation of neural data. This is particularly true for functional MRI (fMRI), where activity maps are generated based upon the evaluation of time varying intensity values throughout the brain from a series of MR volumes. Most neuroscience researchers are not experts in the physics or engineering aspects of MRI and thus rely heavily on experts in these domains to develop and maintain the best scanning environment possible. Thus, MRI experiments are typically done in the context of a core imaging facility. In animal studies, the challenges of MRI are compounded, as technical issues such as the production of specialized radiofrequency (RF) coils and practical skills such as surgery and the animal's behavioral training become additional factors. Animal scanning is typically combined with other procedures such as pharmacological manipulation or simultaneous electrophysiological recording, often further complicating the imaging procedure. Overcoming these obstacles, however, can be of enormous value, since the capacity to map activity over the entire brain is especially powerful when combined with well-conceived manipulations or measurements. The Neurophysiology Imaging Facility (NIF) is organized primarily around the operation of a vertical 4.7T Bruker Biospec scanner, with a 3T Siemens scanner set to be delivered in 2018.  This combination will allow for a spectrum of different scanning possibilities for researchers at the NIH, ranging from routine anatomical scans to intricate, multimodal fMRI projects. The arrival of the new scanner will provide needed additional scanning time for our users, will centralize much of the anatomical scanning, and will accommodate the needs of two newly hired principal investigators. It will also provide for a longer-term transition to replace the 4.7T vertical scanner with a cutting-edge system in the future. Five staff members including Dr. Leopold, each from a different scientific background and with different skills, aim to provide the most efficient functional scanning possible for a broad range of investigators. For structural scanning, the facility staff assists with scans that aid in MRI-targeting of electrophysiological sites, identification of microelectrode positions, evaluation of experimental precision, and, importantly, the direct comparison of electrical recording sites with foci of fMRI responses in the context of a cognitive task. There are a range of contrast options, including diffusion weighted scans that can identify features in the white matter, or provide the basis for tractography. The facility also offers a frameless stereotaxy protocol to assist the surgeon with implantation. This method permits a visualization of the high-resolution scan during surgery, with a real-time depiction of the surgical instruments relative to the scanned brain structures. We have used this approach routinely to aid in the accurate implantation of electrode bundles and chronic cannulae, targeted ablations, and the placement of recording chambers.For functional scanning, much of the work is done by scientists in individual laboratories, which the NIF staff train to become largely autonomous in their experiments.  The Intramural Research Program at the NIH is one of the very few sites around the world in which monkeys can routinely participate in both fMRI and electrophysiological studies. The fMRI studies go beyond mapping functional specialization in the brain. Experiments within the facility typically combine fMRI with other procedures, such as microelectrode recordings or pharmacological inactivation. In the last year, neuroscience in the facility has combined fMRI with cortical ablation, pharmacological inactivation, electrocorticogram recordings, electrical microstimulation, and recordings from chronic microwire arrays. The fMRI experiments produce large data files that must be processed to evaluate the functional activity patterns across the brain. The facility provides storage of these data, as well as help in the initial processing steps.We are further able to combine these techniques with (1) reversible inactivation of electrical neural activity using pharmacological agents, (2) the identification of anatomical pathways using transported, MRI-visible chemicals such as manganese chloride, and (3) electrical microstimulation, where small local currents activate neurons that project to regions that can be detected using the fMRI signal. Surgical targeting is another technique that relies upon particularly high-quality, distortion-free 3-D images of the brain. We have recently implemented algorithms that measure and compensate for small geometric distortions in the images that might hamper surgical precision.The NIF staff spends a relatively small fraction of its time carrying out research related to MRI itself. In the past several years, we have focused on completing studies related to diffusion tractography. Dr. Frank Ye scanned several ex-vivo brains and, in a highly collaborative effort with other groups inside and outside the NIH, we recently published two papers related to the strengths and weakness of MR diffusion tractography (Thomas et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (2014); Reveley et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (2015)).  This research is continuing, and has contributed to three recent publications, including one identifying a new pathway in the macaque (Takemura et al., Cerebral Cortex (2017)) and two creating a macaque template atlas for the entire community (Seidlitz et al., NeuroImage (2017)) and (Reveley et al., Cerebral Cortex (2017)).  Other research lines in the facility involve the development of scanning with newly available contrast agents. At present, research in the facility is focused on the design and testing of implanted radiofrequency coils, with the hope that this method can become routine for users seeking to obtain higher signal-to-noise images.","Ablation;Algorithms;Anatomy;Animals;Atlases;base;Behavioral;Blood;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain scan;Cannulas;Categories;Cerebral cortex;Chemicals;Chronic;cognitive task;Communities;comparative;Contrast Media;Core Facility;Data;Data Files;Data Storage and Retrieval;design;Development;Diffusion;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;diffusion weighted;electrical microstimulation;Electrocorticogram;Electrodes;Electrophysiology (science);Engineering;Environment;Evaluation;experimental study;Functional Imaging;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Heart;Human;Image;Imagery;Imaging Techniques;Implant;implantation;Individual;interest;Intramural Research Program;Joints;Laboratories;Liquid substance;Macaca;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;manganese chloride;Maps;Measurement;Measures;member;Methods;Microelectrodes;Monkeys;multimodality;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;neuroimaging;Neuronavigation;Neurons;neurophysiology;Neurosciences;Neurosciences Research;Noise;nonhuman primate;operation;Operative Surgical Procedures;Paper;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pharmacology;Physics;Positioning Attribute;Principal Investigator;Procedures;Process;Production;programs;Protocols documentation;Publications;Publishing;radiofrequency;relating to nervous system;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resolution;response;Role;Scanning;Scientist;sensory stimulus;Series;Services;Signal Transduction;Site;skills;Structure;Surgeon;Surgical Instruments;System;targeted imaging;Techniques;Testing;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;tractography;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;white matter;Work;","NEUROPHYSIOLOGY IMAGING FACILITY CORE:  FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL MRI",n/a,"NIMH","9568290","","",1ZICMH002899-11,1,ZIC,MH,002899,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8014338","LEOPOLD, DAVID A",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,894326,
"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Mental Health;Neurosciences","There are multiple uses of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the study of nonhuman primate neuroscience, each of which aims to make the research as precise and efficient, and as relevant to humans, as possible.  The NIF facility at the NIH strives to make both structural and functional imaging feasible and fluid for any laboratories on the NIH campus interested in applying these methods.  We offer high resolution anatomical scans, diffusion imaging, as well as comprehensive functional imaging.  With the latter comes a step-by-step program to help scientists gain autonomy in conducting their functional MRI experiments, which are often difficult and most fruitful when combined with other methods. At the heart of the facilitys operation is functional MRI (fMRI), which allows researchers to visualize activity patterns within the brain, often mapping the responses for one type of sensory stimulus relative to that for another.  This straightforward type of mapping, which is routine in humans, is also routine in nonhuman primates as long as the experimental components and infrastructure are in place. A large number of steps lie between the acquisition of raw MR signals and the interpretation of neural data. This is particularly true for functional MRI (fMRI), where activity maps are generated based upon the evaluation of time varying intensity values throughout the brain from a series of MR volumes. Most neuroscience researchers are not experts in the physics or engineering aspects of MRI and thus rely heavily on experts in these domains to develop and maintain the best scanning environment possible. Thus, MRI experiments are typically done in the context of a core imaging facility. In animal studies, the challenges of MRI are compounded, as technical issues such as the production of specialized radiofrequency (RF) coils and practical skills such as surgery and the animal's behavioral training become additional factors. Animal scanning is typically combined with other procedures such as pharmacological manipulation or simultaneous electrophysiological recording, often further complicating the imaging procedure.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Genetics;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Schizophrenia","Synapses can change their efficacy through synaptic plasticity. Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity (such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression of synaptic transmission) are important cellular mechanisms underlying information storage in the brain and the establishment of proper neural circuits during development. In this project, we investigated the mechanism underlying long-term depression of synaptic transmission. Our study shows that macroautophagy (autophagy hereinafter) plays an important role in LTD. Autophagy is a cellular process by which cytoplasmic components and organelles are delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy removes misfolded or aggregated proteins and defective organelles. Dysfunctional autophagy has been associated with neurological disorders. Autophagy is also essential for the development and function of synapses. It enables developmental pruning of dendritic spines (subcellular structures accommodating postsynaptic components), regulates presynaptic structure and dopamine release, and regulates degradation of postsynaptic receptors.Autophay is initiated by the formation of a phagophore (the isolation membrane). The phagophore expands into autophagosomes (a double membrane structure) to sequester the cargo, and then fuses with lysosomes to become an autolysosome where the cargo is degraded. These processes are orchestrated by more than 30 autophagy-related (Atg) proteins and multiple signaling pathways. Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is the best-characterized regulator of autophagy induction in mammalian cells. It inhibits autophagy initiation by phosphorylating ULK1/2 (Unc-51-like kinase) and Atg13. Using mTOR inhibitors and knockout mice with deficient autophagy, we found that autophagic fluxis changed during LTD and this in turn leads toAMPA receptor endocytosis. During this reporting period, we investigated the mechanism by which autophagy is regulated in LTD and how autophagy contributes to LTD. We also examined the behavior of mice in which autophagic flux is altered. 2. The mechanism by which the schizophrenia risk gene dysbindin contributes to synaptopathology in schizophrenia. Dysbindin is a coiled-coil domain containing protein, initially discovered as a dystrophin-binding protein and later found to be one of eight subunits of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the dysbindin gene (Dtnbp1) have been associated with higher risk for schizophrenia, and the postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients consistently exhibit low levels of dysbindin proteins and mRNAs. Our earlier work shows that dysbindin contributes to the establishment of neuronal connectivity by regulating the development of dendritic protrusions, including dendritic spines (tiny dendritic protrusions where excitatory synapses are formed) and filopodia (long, thin protrusions that predominant in young neurons). Dysbindin, therefore, may confer the risk for schizophrenia by regulating the development of dendritic spines. Psychiatric disease is commonly precipitated by psychological stress. It is largely unclear how stress interacts with genetic risk factors in the etiology of schizophrenia. In this project, we investigated the effect of stress on the behavior of dysbindin null mutant mice. We found that mild stress that does not significantly affect the behavior of wild-type mice induces behaviors that are related to the symptom of schizophrenia in mutant mice. We recorded in the brain slices of stressed mice and found that stress alters synaptic physiology in mutant but not in wild-type mice. During this reporting period, we examined the effect of stress on synaptic physiology in sdy mice. We also set up a two-photon microscopy system to take images of dendritic spines in awake, behaving mice. We will use this system to investigate whether and how stress affects the number, morphology and dynamics of dendritic spines in the brain.","Adverse event;Affect;Anxiety Disorders;Autistic Disorder;Autophagocytosis;Autophagosome;Autopsy;awake;Behavior;Behavioral;Binding Proteins;Biogenesis;Brain;Cell physiology;Cognitive;Coiled-Coil Domain;Complex;Dendritic Spines;Development;Dopamine;Dystrophin;Emotional;Endocytosis;Etiology;Excitatory Synapse;Exhibits;experience;Filopodia;FRAP1 gene;Genes;genetic risk factor;Goals;high risk;Image;Information Storage;insight;Knockout Mice;Long-Term Depression;Long-Term Potentiation;Lysosomes;Mammalian Cell;Membrane;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Messenger RNA;Microscopy;Molecular;Morphology;mTOR Inhibitor;Mus;mutant;Mutant Strains Mice;nervous system disorder;neural circuit;Neurons;Organelles;Pathology;Patients;Phosphotransferases;Physiology;Play;postsynaptic;postsynaptic neurons;presynaptic;presynaptic neurons;Preventive;Process;protein aggregate;Proteins;Psychological Stress;receptor;Reporting;Risk;risk variant;Role;Schizophrenia;Signal Pathway;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Site;Slice;stem;Stress;Structure;Subcellular structure;Symptoms;Synapses;synaptic function;Synaptic plasticity;Synaptic Transmission;System;Therapeutic;Thinness;two-photon;Wild Type Mouse;Work;","MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF SYNAPSE DEVELOPMENT AND PLASTICITY",n/a,"NIMH","9568266","","",1ZIAMH002881-11,1,ZIA,MH,002881,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416721","LI, ZHENG ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,978038,
"Biotechnology;Brain Disorders;Genetics;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Schizophrenia;Serious Mental Illness","miRNAs have been implicated in schizophrenia. Mutations in genes encoding miRNAs or components in the miRNA biogenesis machinery are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. It is hypothesized that miRNA expression is aberrant in schizophrenia patients. Using microarray and quantitative PCR, several groups have examined miRNA expression in postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients, and consistently detected miRNA expression change. However, the findings in the patients brains have been inconsistent. In this project, we employed the next-generation sequencing technology to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in schizophrenic brains. We also analyzed the effect of psychiatric medications and tobacco smoking on miRNA expression. Using bioinformatics, we found that the targets of miRNAs differentially expressed in schizophrenia patients are enriched for genes encoding synaptic proteins and genes associated with risk for schizophrenia. During this reporting period, we selected a couple of miRNAs exhibiting the most significant changes in schizophrenia patients, and generated reagents to overexpress and knock down them in mouse brain. We will use these reagents to examine the effect of miRNA expression change on synaptic physiology and behavior in mice. We also established cultures of human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) and differentiated them into neurons. We will use these cells to examine the function of miRNAs in the development of IPSC-derived human neurons.","Autopsy;Behavior;Biogenesis;Bioinformatics;Brain;Cell Differentiation process;Cells;Dendritic Spines;Development;differential expression;Exhibits;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Human;induced pluripotent stem cell;knock-down;Learning;Longevity;Memory;Messenger RNA;MicroRNAs;Mus;Mutation;neurodevelopment;Neurons;next generation sequencing;overexpression;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Play;protein expression;Proteins;Reagent;Regulation;Reporting;Risk;Role;Schizophrenia;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;Synaptic Transmission;Technology;Tobacco smoking;Translations;Untranslated RNA;","CHARACTERIZING THE FUNCTION OF MIRNAS IN NEURAL DEVELOPMENT; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY AND SCHIZOPHRENIA.",n/a,"NIMH","9568267","","",1ZIAMH002882-11,1,ZIA,MH,002882,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416721","LI, ZHENG ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,652025,

We have undertaken an effort to combine and share as much information as possible between Neurobiobank (NBB) and HBCC resources. For this we obtained detailed quantitative electronic toxicological data from NMS on hundreds of our specimens and shared them with NBB. We are implementing a transition to DSM5/ICD10 codes that will make our diagnostic definitions easily sharable with NBB. We have unified the naming and reporting of brain regions/specimens available in HBCC with the goal of making these fields easily available to NBB and investigators (work in progress as we have 46,000 biospecimens available).

We now have a fully functional noninvasive neuromodulation laboratory operating for use with human subjects installed in the inpatient unit in the Clinical Center. Training in the safe and effective delivery of neuromodulation is one of our major functions as a Service within the Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging . To date, 67 individuals have received in-service training on TMS safety, 46 hands-on training sessions have been provided, 26  distinct individuals have received intensive hands-on training sessions (6 from NINDS, 3 from NIDA, 3 from NCCIH, and 14 from NIMH) including physicians, neuroscientists, advanced practice nurses, and students. Hands-on training sessions have covered the following procedures: Motor threshold determination, electromyography (EMG), Paired pulse TMS measures of cortical excitability, simultaneous TMS/EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials, Somatosensory evoked potentials, Paired Associative Stimulation (a paradigm which induces neural plasticity),  TMS-Safety procedures, and the role of Nursing in TMS and patient management.Our planned projects fall into 3 themes: 1) measuring neuroplasticity, 2) modulating neuroplasticity, 3) modeling the effects of neuromodulation and mining multi-modal datasets to discover biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response. Our projects include:Theme I:  Measuring NeuroplasticityMechanisms of Rapid Antidepressant Action collaboration with Drs. Zarate and Parko This project develops biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response through the addition of TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG and TMS-fMRI neuroplasticity measures to the existing intramural research program on ketamine, and adding a seizure therapy comparison arm. Concurrent fMRI-guided rTMS and cognitive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodeso This project (which also incorporates Theme II, below) uses MEG (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI,  and TMS/EEG to measure brain network engagement and neuroplastic changes due to  multimodal TMS/CBT in depressed subjects.Theme II: Modulating NeuroplasticityWe are taking complementary approaches to modulating neuroplasticity: 1) seizure-induced neuroplasticity, 2) paired associative stimulation (PAS) and 3) novel tool development to extend the spatial and temporal specificity of noninvasive neuromodulation. Next generation seizure therapy collaboration with Drs. Zarate, Park, Bikson, Dattao Therapeutically induced seizures exert rapid antidepressant action and are robust inducers of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis. New technologies for focal seizure induction may improve the risk/benefit ratio by lowering cognitive side effects, and also provide the valuable scientific opportunity to examine common mechanisms across rapidly acting interventions such as ketamine. o This project involves optimization of seizure therapy dosing, through the study of individualized low amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST), comprised of focal seizure induction with minimal current exposure to improve tolerability of seizure therapy for depression. Cognitive Paired Associative Stimulation (C-PAS) o PAS has been shown to strengthen synaptic efficacy within a circuit through repeated co-activation and coincident firing. We extend that approach to activate a targeted neural circuit through cognitive task performance, and couple that with simultaneous focal neuromodulation to enhance plasticity, as a means of enhancing circuit function and improving the functional-specificity of neuromodulation action. One of our projects employs fMRI-guided TMS paired with a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression (in collaboration with Dr. Strauman). Another of our projects, being conducted in the form of a cooperative agreement (5U01AG050618) uses fMRI-guided TMS with simultaneous working memory training to enhance executive function in older adults (in collaboration with Drs. Appelbaum, Peterchev, and Cabeza).Noninvasive focal deep brain stimulation (nfDBS)o Noninvasive brain stimulation is either focal and superficial, or deep and broad. Its utility as a clinical and research tool hinges on the ability to improve the spatial and temporal aspects of targeting. These projects address innovative approaches to improve the spatial resolution of TMS at depth, to precisely target deep brain structures and distributed networks of interest. Transcranial direction current stimulation to reduce effects of nicotine withdrawal syndromeNIDA Protocol 12-DA-N474 (PI: E.A.Stein, collaborators: Betty Jo Salmeron, Sarah Aronson)Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal remain a major impediment for smokers trying to quit, with most quit attempts failing within the first week of abstinence when withdrawal symptoms are at their height. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. The goal is to investigate the effects of tDCS on modulating large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal. Neural mechanisms underlying noninvasive brain stimulation assisted motor skill learning in older adults (Grant submitted to the Australian Research Council DP180101997)We combine animal and human models to examine the mechanisms underlying tDCS modulated motor skill learning in older adults and brain connectivity with a multimodal approach.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Neurosciences","This past year we have continued to focus on a major part of long-term memory, termed semantic memory, that is composed of general information, such as facts, ideas, and the meaning of objects and words. We are particularly interested in characterizing the neural substrate mediating object and word meaning and its role in object perception. We are also interested in understanding how abstract knowledge, such as information about social interactions, is represented. Our studies have shown that information about salient properties of an object - such as what it looks like, how it moves, how it is used, and our affective reaction to it - are stored in our perceptual, action, and emotion systems. As a result, objects belonging to different categories such as animate entities (people, animals) and manmade manipulable objects (tools, utensils) are represented in partially distinct neural circuits. These distributed circuits also underpin our ability to understand more abstract events such as social and mechanical interactions (Martin 2016). One brain region that has been consistently associated with processing social information is the most anterior and superior region of the temporal lobe.  Surprisingly, this brain region has also been associated with a completely different function - processing of written sentences.  We noticed that many of these sentence processing studies used sentences that were nearly exclusively about social and/or social emotional situations.  We reasoned that perhaps it was the content of these sentences, rather than sentence reading per se, that was driving activity in anterior temporal cortex. To evaluate this possibility we present word lists that differed in phrase length (single words, 3-word phrases, 6-word sentences) and semantic content (social-emotional, social, and inanimate objects). This allowed us to investigate if anterior temporal cortex responded to increasing phrase size (as a marker of sentence processing) with or without regard to a specific domain of concepts expressed in these sentences, i.e., social and/or social emotional content (Mellem et al., 2016).Our results showed that neural activity in anterior temporal cortex was modulated by word phrase length.  However, this activity was strongly modulated by sentence content such that social and social-emotional concepts were preferred over material devoid of social content (i.e., limited to inanimate objects). Reading also induced content type effects in other brain regions associated with social processing including the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex.  In contrast, brain regions associated with processing information about inanimate objects responded most strongly to the non-social object phases and sentences. These findings extend our knowledge of the types of stimuli that social brain regions respond to (in this case simply reading about social interactions) and stress the importance of taking meaning into account when study the neural underpinnings of sentence processing.Progress has also been made on understanding the apparent category-related organization of ventral temporal cortex.  One of the most robust and oft-replicated findings in cognitive neuroscience is that different regions of ventral temporal cortex respond preferentially to different categories of concrete objects. However, the determinants of this category-related organization remain to be fully established. We, and others, have recently proposed that a major contributing factor to this organization is privileged connectivity from each of these ventral temporal regions to other brain regions that store property information associated with that category. To test this hypothesis, we used fMRI to define category-related brain regions of interest (ROIs) in a large group of subjects (Stevens et al., 2017). We then used these ROIs in resting-state functional connectivity MRI analyses to explore functional connectivity among these regions. Our results demonstrate that distinct category-preferring regions of ventral temporal cortex show differentially stronger functional connectivity with other regions that have congruent category preference.  Moreover, the strength of these connections varied with behavior. The better subjects performed on a specific cognitive task like word reading, the stronger the connectivity between regions responsible for visual word identification and language comprehension (Stevens et al., 2017).  These findings support the claim that privileged connectivity with other cortical regions provides a powerful constraint on the category-related organization of this region of the brain.","Affective;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Anterior;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Brain;Brain region;Categories;cognitive neuroscience;cognitive task;Complex;Emotional;Emotions;Event;Foundations;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Human;Impairment;information processing;interest;Knowledge;language comprehension;Length;long term memory;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetoencephalography;Measures;Mechanics;Medial;Mediating;Memory;neural circuit;neuropsychiatric disorder;object perception;Phase;phrases;preference;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Property;Protocols documentation;Reaction;Reading;relating to nervous system;Research;Rest;Retrieval;Role;Semantic memory;Semantics;social;social cognition;Social Interaction;Stimulus;Stress;Structure;System;Temporal Lobe;Testing;tool;Visual;Work;","THE NEURAL FOUNDATIONS FOR MEMORY  AND SOCIAL COGNITION IN THE HUMAN BRAIN",n/a,"NIMH","9568248","","",1ZIAMH002588-27,1,ZIA,MH,002588,27,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6482398","MARTIN, ALEX ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,855771,
"Autism;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD);Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","This past year we have continued to evaluate the neural characteristics and associated behavioral consequences of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Prevailing theories suggest that ASD results from impaired brain communication due to aberrant timing or coordination of neuronal firing patterns (impaired synchrony). However, it remains debated whether synchrony abnormalities in ASD are among local and/or long-range circuits, are circuit-specific or are generalized, reflect increased (hyper-) synchrony and/or decreased (hypo-) synchrony, and whether they are frequency band specific or are distributed across the frequency spectrum. In previous studies, we used data driven techniques in conjunction with both fMRI and structural data to show that the abnormalities in ASD brain networks are most prominent within brain regions that support social functions. To provide an additional test of this hypothesis, as well as determine how oscillatory neural dynamics are affected in ASD, we recorded spontaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in 17 high functioning adolescents and adults with ASD and 18 controls matched on age, IQ, and sex, and equated for motion during the scanning session. We used a method we recently developed to look at all-to-all synchronization across the brain in conjunction with data driven analyses to compare local and long-distance synchrony in a frequency-specific manner. We found that individuals with ASD showed local increased or hypersynchrony in the theta band (4-7 Hz) in lateral occipitotemporal cortex. We also observed long-range decreased or hyposynchronous activity in the alpha band (10-13 Hz) that was most prominent in neural circuitry underpinning social processing. The magnitude of this alpha band hyposynchrony was correlated with social symptom severity. These results suggest that while ASD is associated with both decreased long-range synchrony and increased posterior local synchrony - with each effect limited to a specific frequency band - impairments in social functioning may be most related to decreased alpha synchronization between critical nodes of the social processing network (Ghuman et al., 2017).To extend our understanding of these social deficits, we evaluated developmental changes in social functioning in 324 individuals with ASD, without intellectual impairment, compared to 438 typically developing subjects ranging in age from 4 to 29.  We found that as they approach adolescence/adulthood the subjects with ASD fell increasing behind their age-matched peers in their social-communicative skills, indicating that social difficulties become more, rather than less pronounced in ASD during development (Wallace et al., 2017).We also completed two studies of higher-order executive functions, such as planning, organization skills, and cognitive flexibility, that strongly impact activities of daily living.  In one of these studies (Wallace et al., 2016) we found that impairments of executive functions persist into adulthood and are associated with both depression and anxiety in ASD.  We also evaluated executive functioning and adaptive behaviors in the largest study to date of sex differences in executive functions in ASD (White et al., 2017).  Our study included 79 females and 158 males with ASD.  Our results indicated relative weaknesses for females compared to males diagnosed with ASD on executive function and daily living skills. These differences occur in the absence of sex differences in our sample in age, IQ, clinician ratings of core ASD symptomatology, parent ratings of ADHD symptoms, and parent-reported social and communication adaptive skills on the VABS. These findings indicate specific liabilities in real world executive functions and daily living skills for females with ASD and have important implications for targeting their treatments.","Activities of Daily Living;Adaptive Behaviors;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Age;Anxiety;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;autism spectrum disorder;base;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain region;Characteristics;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive neuroscience;Communication;Data;Development;developmental disease;Diagnosis;Executive Dysfunction;executive function;Eye;Female;flexibility;Frequencies;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Impairment;Individual;instrument;Lateral;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetoencephalography;male;Measures;Memory;Mental Depression;Methods;Motion;neural circuit;neural correlate;neuroimaging;Neurons;Neuropsychological Tests;Neuropsychology;Parents;Pattern;peer;Pervasive Development Disorder;Protocols documentation;Questionnaires;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Sampling;Scanning;Severities;sex;Sex Characteristics;skills;social;social communication;Social Functioning;Social Interaction;Social support;symptomatology;Symptoms;Techniques;Technology;Testing;theories;Work;","THE COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9568276","","",1ZIAMH002920-09,1,ZIA,MH,002920,09,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6482398","MARTIN, ALEX ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1283656,

Current neuroimaging genetics work is focused on magnetic resonance imaging. We have contributed genotypes and imaging data to the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) brain imaging consortium, which brings together imaging and genetics data from around the world in order to generate the large sample sizes needed for robust results. In addition, enrollees in our ongoing genetic study of BD in people of Anabaptist ancestry (ZIA-MH002843-14) are referred to UMD where they undergo diffusion tensor imaging as part of the ongoing Amish Connectome Study. Neuroimaging  endophenotypes may shed light on the mechanisms whereby common genetic variants influence risk for a variety of psychiatric disorders. Following upon published pilot studies, this year we completed  RNA-sequencing in an additional 200 postmortem brain samples obtained from people with and without major psychiatric disorders. This study focused on the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, implicated in people with mood disorders. Gene-level and transcript-level analyses, recently completed, point to a major role for alternative splicing in differentiating major psychiatric disorders (BD, schizophrenia and major depression). Gene co-expression analysis highlights immune-related genes and pathways which are specifically expressed in microglia. Ongoing studies in this sample include validation of differentially expressed genes and transcripts, along with expression quantitative trait (eQTL) and splicing QTL analyses aimed at linking genetic variants found by genetic association studies with particular genes.In the coming year, we plan to increase the resolution of gene expression in postmortem brain to the single-cell level, using new techniques that facilitate capture and RNA sequencing of individual cell nuclei isolated from frozen tissue. This project will help us identify the cell-type specific genes and transcripts that are dysregulated in the brains of people with mental illness.We also seek to model the functional genomics of disease-related genes in cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) provide a renewable cellular template to conduct various investigations into disease-associated features and mechanisms at the early stage of neuronal development. This project aims to explore the ways in which we can use iPSC technology to study the biological impact of genes and genetic mutations that we identify in our other ongoing studies. Working with the NIH Center for Regenerative Medicine, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) stem cell cores we have so far successfully reprogrammed fibroblasts into iPSCs from 15 individuals ascertained in our ongoing family studies of bipolar disorder. We are growing the cells into neural progenitor cells, neurons, and glia. These cells are then studied with high-resolution microscopic imaging, electrophysiology, and gene expression methods. These data could reveal differences between control and patient-derived cells and the impact of known and novel therapeutic agents. In the coming year, we plan to expand our iPSC lines from additional families. In collaboration with Joseph Steiner (NINDS), we are developing a morphologic assay to measure the effect of known therapeutics and stressors on dendritic number and length following differentiation of NPCs into neurons. We are also exploring ways to measure the functional impact of genetic mutations at the cellular level and to use genome editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 to rescue cellular phenotypes and establish a causal role for specific genetic mutations. We also plan to apply single-cell sequencing technology to iPSC-derived cells in order to explore the diversity of gene sequence and expression across individual cells from the same donor, which can be an important source of variation in human iPSC studies.  The above approaches may illuminate important features that contribute to disruption of biological mechanisms during the disease process and provide reproducible assays for high throughput screening for novel therapeutics. Multigenic disorders such as BD pose special challenges for experimental studies, since a single causative mutation is usually not identifiable. For this reason, We are also studying rare, single-gene disorders whose symptoms overlap with those seen in more common mental illnesses. Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral abnormalities and disruptions in circadian rhythm. The majority of SMS cases are caused by small deletions of chromosome 17, but a few very rare cases are caused by single mutations in RAI1, a gene located within the deleted region. Study samples that carry an established single gene defect permit gene editing for comparative studies between cells with and without the causative mutation. Skin cells from people living with SMS obtained in collaboration with Ann Smith (NHGRI), the co-discoverer of SMS, have been reprogrammed into iPSCs. These will be differentiated into neurons and other brain cells in the coming year. Findings from this study may have relevance to other neuropsychiatric disorders with circadian rhythm disturbances, such as depression and BD.","age group;Alternative Splicing;Amish;Anterior;Autopsy;Behavioral;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Biology;Bipolar Disorder;Blood;Brain;brain cell;Brain imaging;brain tissue;Cause of Death;Cell Line;Cell model;Cell Nucleus;cell type;Cells;Cessation of life;Chromosome Deletion;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17;cingulate cortex;Circadian Rhythms;Collaborations;Comparative Study;connectome;Copy Number Polymorphism;CRISPR/Cas technology;Data;differential expression;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;disability;Disease;DNA;DNA Sequence Alteration;Electrophysiology (science);endophenotype;experimental study;Family;Family Study;Fibroblasts;Freezing;functional genomics;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genetic;genetic association;Genetic study;genetic variant;Genetic Variation;genome editing;genome wide association study;Genotype;Goals;healthy volunteer;high throughput screening;Human;Human Volunteers;Image;imaging genetics;Immune;Impairment;Individual;induced pluripotent stem cell;interest;Investigation;Length;Life;Light;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Major Depressive Disorder;Measures;Mendelian disorder;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Meta-Analysis;Methods;Microglia;microscopic imaging;Modeling;Mood Disorders;Morphology;Mutation;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;National Human Genome Research Institute;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;nerve stem cell;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neuroglia;neuroimaging;neuron development;Neurons;neuropsychiatric disorder;novel therapeutics;Occupational;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Process;Public Health;Publishing;Quantitative Trait Loci;Regenerative Medicine;Reproducibility;Resolution;Risk;Risk Factors;risk variant;RNA Splicing;Role;Sample Size;Sampling;Sampling Studies;Schizophrenia;screening;severe mental illness;single cell sequencing;Single-Gene Defect;Skin;Smith Magenis syndrome;social;Source;Stem cells;stressor;Suicide;Symptoms;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Tissues;tool;trait;Transcript;transcriptome sequencing;United States National Institutes of Health;Use of New Techniques;Validation;Variant;Work;","FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS OF BIPOLAR DISORDER",n/a,"NIMH","9568259","","",1ZIAMH002810-15,1,ZIA,MH,002810,15,,Unavailable,"","","",,"1893483","MCMAHON, FRANCIS J",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1400314,
"Biotechnology;Bipolar Disorder;Brain Disorders;Depression;Genetics;Human Genome;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Prevention;Serious Mental Illness","NCT00001174Starting in 1993, in collaboration with 10 academic centers across the US, we recruited a large sample of over 3,000 individuals with bipolar or other mood disorders. All participants did a diagnostic interview and provided a blood sample for DNA analysis. DNA and clinical data are available through the NIMH Center for Genetics. Genetic linkage studies suggested several chromosomal regions may contain genes that contribute to mood disorders in this sample.To identify individual causal genes, we conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bipolar disorder (BD) in 2007. The results implicated several genes, each of small effect, suggesting that BD is a polygenic disease. A second, larger study published in 2010 implicated a cluster of genes on chromosome 3p21 and suggested genetic overlap with major depression. An even larger study published in 2013 that included patients of Asian ancestry supported many of the previous findings and found 3 additional genetic markers of BD. Most of these findings have now been replicated in independent samples. To identify additional risk loci, this year we performed a meta-analysis of >9 million genetic variants in over 40,000 individuals, the largest GWAS of BD to date. To increase power, we used 2,000 lithium-treated cases with a long-term diagnosis of BD from the Consortium on Lithium Genetics, excess controls, and analytic methods optimized for markers on the X-chromosome. In addition to 4 known loci, we identified 2 novel loci. Our results added to a growing list of common variants involved in BD.To identify rarer genetic variants that may have a larger impact on risk for major mood disorders, we have undertaken genome sequencing studies in families and special populations. So far, we have collected more than 700 individuals from Amish and Mennonite communities whose unique genetic history makes them especially good candidates for this kind of study. All blood samples are processed by the Rutgers Cell and DNA Repository, which also establishes lymphoblastoid cell lines and distributes DNA as a resource for the general scientific community. Last year we added additional measures of neurocognition to our assessments. These data will allow us to better characterize the range of phenotypes present in carriers of risk alleles, many of whom are not expected to have diagnosable mental illness. Through a collaboration with investigators at the Univ of Maryland, we will also investigate brain connectivity in selected cases, using multi-modal neuroimaging. Skin biopsies are obtained on sequenced individuals and converted to fibroblasts. Several fibroblast lines have been reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells for functional genomic studies (see ZIA-MH002810-15).Genome sequencing began in 2012 using technology that captured only the exome, or the expressed portions of the genome. Although no rare, damaging mutations were found that were shared by the majority of cases in our study, we did identify many promising variants shared by distantly-related cases. These variants were submitted to the Bipolar Sequencing Consortium where they have become part of a large meta-analysis that brings together samples from many groups around the world in order to improve statistical power to detect variants of modest effect. In collaboration with investigators at Regeneron, Inc., we have performed exome sequencing on 715 participants. We are now working on the data analyses. With this data set, we will be able to look for recurrent rare mutations, as well as mutations that have accumulated within individual genes and gene-sets. The current sample size is well powered to detect variants that confer substantial risk for BD. If such variants are not detected, larger samples will be needed to detect variants that confer more modest risk of illness.  In collaboration with ISB, and the Bipolar Disorder Genome Study (BiGS), we have analyzed whole-genome sequences performed on 200 members of 41 families multiply affected with BD. Several classes of coding and non-coding (regulatory) variants segregating in these pedigrees were enriched for neuronal excitability genes. Ongoing work is aimed at confirming these findings in additional samples and characterizing the functional impact of the implicated genetic variants. If confirmed, these results could have important implications for our understanding of the causes of BD and provide clues for better treatment.In collaboration with investigators at the Univ Pennsylvania, Univ Miami, Case Western Reserve, and Univ Kansas, we have performed whole-genome sequencing on a larger set of individuals ascertained from Amish and Mennonite communities. The goal was to develop a population specific reference panel (the Anabaptist Genome Reference Panel or AGRP) that will allow us to infer rare genetic variants in individuals who have not undergone whole genome sequencing, thus increasing sample size at greatly reduced cost. Phase I of the AGRP was completed this year. While the data cannot be distributed, we have set up an imputation server so outside researchers working with Anabaptist populations can use the AGRP to impute their own samples. We have recently completed whole genome sequencing on another set of 60 Anabaptists. We will be incorporating this new data set with our existing data to further increase the imputation accuracy of rare variants.We are also searching for genetic markers that help predict response to lithium, one of the most effective treatments for BD.  In collaboration with Univ Bonn, we did genome-wide genotyping on over 3000 cases. Confirmed biomarkers of lithium response would be an important step forward in the care of people with BD. We organized a large international collaboration, known as the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen), aimed at characterizing lithium response in large groups of patients using reliable instruments, followed by GWAS. Last year we found 4 markers in the same region on chromosome 21 that were associated with lithium response and supported by study in an independent sample. Over the past year, additional analyses in this dataset demonstrated that common genetic variants associated with schizophrenia predicted poorer response to lithium and, in joint analyses, implicated additional genetic loci harboring variants involved in both lithium response and schizophrenia risk. In the coming year, we will seek to replicate and extend these findings in additional large samples.","3p21;Affect;age group;Amish;analytical method;Asians;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Bipolar Disorder;Blood specimen;Brain;Caring;Cause of Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Chromosomes;Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21;Clinical;Clinical Data;Code;Collaborations;Communities;cost;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;disability;Disease;Distant;DNA;DNA analysis;DNA Repository;effective therapy;exome;exome sequencing;Family;Fibroblasts;Functional disorder;functional genomics;Gene Cluster;Genes;Genetic;genetic linkage;Genetic Markers;genetic pedigree;genetic variant;Genome;genome sequencing;genome wide association study;genome-wide;Genotype;Goals;Impairment;improved;Individual;induced pluripotent stem cell;instrument;International;Interview;Joints;Kansas;Life;Lithium;lymphoblastoid cell line;Major Depressive Disorder;Maryland;Measures;member;Mennonite;Mental disorders;Meta-Analysis;Methods;Modality;Mood Disorders;Mutation;named group;National Institute of Mental Health;Neurocognition;neuroimaging;neuronal excitability;novel;Occupational;Participant;Patients;Pennsylvania;Phase;Phenotype;Population;predicting response;Prevention;Process;Publishing;rare variant;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Recurrence;reference genome;Research Personnel;Resources;response;Risk;Risk Factors;risk variant;Sample Size;Sampling;Schizophrenia;severe mental illness;Skin;social;Source;Suicide;Technology;treatment response;Untranslated RNA;Variant;whole genome;Work;X Chromosome;","IDENTIFICATION OF GENES INVOLVED IN MAJOR MOOD DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9568261","","",1ZIAMH002843-14,1,ZIA,MH,002843,14,,Unavailable,"","","",,"1893483","MCMAHON, FRANCIS J",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1400314,
"Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities;Complementary and Alternative Medicine;Depression;Genetics;Human Genome;Major Depressive Disorder;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Minority Health;Patient Safety;Precision Medicine;Serious Mental Illness","NCT00088699Strong evidence from family and twin studies demonstrates that major depressive disorder (MDD) is heritable, yet there has been limited progress in identifying the actual genes involved. A separate, perhaps overlapping set of genes is expected to play a role in individual variation in treatment response in MDD. By use of a large set of markers in many genes, we seek to characterize patients who differ in their response to standard antidepressant treatments. Past work led by an extramurally-funded fellow investigated why minority participants in clinical trials drop out of treatment and experience poorer treatment response than non-minorities. The research showed that race, ethnicity, genetic ancestry, and other factors affected Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) treatment response, but African ancestry remained a significant risk factor for poor response, even after other factors were taken into account. In the first years of this project, candidate genes studies implicated a few genes in treatment outcome and other genes in adverse effects. Future studies are needed to determine whether individuals who carry such genetic markers may benefit from closer monitoring or alternative treatments. We also participated in a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies of antidepressant outcome. Despite greater power of this combined sample to uncover association with common genetic markers, no genome-wide significant associations were found. We concluded that no common alleles of large effect on antidepressant outcome exist in these samples. In the past year, we re-examined this question in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) sample using newer analysis methods that improve upon older genotyping techniques initially used in this sample. In collaboration with Dr. Yin Yao and colleagues at NIMH, we carried out a new genome wide association study of antidepressant response in the STAR*D sample. We chose treatment response at study exit (after 2 to 12 weeks of citalopram treatment) as the main outcome, since our preliminary analyses showed this to be the most heritable phenotype. We found one SNP that was associated with this outcome at genome-wide significance, and identified some nearby genes. Ongoing work is aimed at replicating this finding in additional samples.  We are now using new, high-throughput sequencing methods to test for rarer genetic variants that may exert larger effects, at least in patients with treatment resistant depression. Such variants may show larger effects, especially among patients with unusual treatment outcomes. Patients who respond to antidepressant treatment constitute a mixture of true responders, placebo responders, and those whose illness remits spontaneously. Patients who fail to respond to multiple treatments may be less heterogeneous, since placebo responders and spontaneous remitters are removed. From over 4,000 patients enrolled in the STAR*D study, we found that only 10% show treatment resistance that is not explained by non-adherence, comorbid substance use disorder, or other factors, and only 3% are highly treatment-resistant. Sequencing of the coding regions of the genome (exome) has now been completed on 150 treatment-resistant and 25 'typically responsive' patients. Samples were drawn from the STAR*D, the Univ. Michigan Depression Center, and patients enrolled in NIMH studies of novel antidepressants such as ketamine and scopolamine. Much of the exome sequencing was carried out at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center with funds provided by the NIH Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO) program. Of the 350,000 high-quality genetic variants that have been identified so far, about 100,000 are rare variants within the protein-coding regions of genes. We are now exploring various filtering strategies aimed at developing a list of genes that harbor deleterious variants in people with treatment-resistant depression. Pathway analysis of the implicated genes may point toward biological pathways important in the causes and treatment of major depression.In the coming year, we plan to expand the sample size in order to increase power and identify the genes most robustly associated with treatment resistance. We also plan to analyze a comparison sample of about 1000 individuals whose DNA also underwent exome sequencing as part of the CCGO study. These individuals will provide an important comparison sample that may reveal additional genes or pathways that could be good targets for development of novel therapeutics.","Adverse effects;Adverse event;Affect;African;Alleles;alternative treatment;Antidepressive Agents;anxiety treatment;Biological;Biological Factors;Candidate Disease Gene;Citalopram;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Code;Collaborations;Comorbidity;cost;Development;Disease remission;DNA;Drops;effective therapy;Enrollment;Ethnic Origin;exome;exome sequencing;experience;Extramural Activities;Family Study;Feeling suicidal;Funding;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Determinism;Genetic Markers;genetic variant;Genome;genome wide association study;genome-wide;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Heritability;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;improved;Individual;insight;Ketamine;Learning;Light;Major Depressive Disorder;Mental Depression;Meta-Analysis;Methods;Michigan;Minority;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;National Institute of Mental Health;novel;novel therapeutics;Open Reading Frames;Outcome;Outcome Study;Participant;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patients;personalized approach;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Placebos;Play;programs;Race;rare variant;Recovery;Research;Resistance;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sample Size;Sampling;Scopolamine;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor;social;Substance Use Disorder;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;therapy resistant;Time;Treatment outcome;treatment response;treatment-resistant depression;Twin Studies;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Withdrawal;Work;Yin;","GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE",n/a,"NIMH","9568262","","",1ZIAMH002844-14,1,ZIA,MH,002844,14,,Unavailable,"","","",,"1893483","MCMAHON, FRANCIS J",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,311181,

Recruitment of probands and evaluation of relatives are near completion and analyses of the findings are underway.To date, about 550 probands and about 1000 of their relatives have completed the study, including over 150 children between the ages of 7-17.  Approximately 500 individuals have also been evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center.  Probands represent a large range of disorders including mood, anxiety, sleep, migraine, and cardiovascular in addition to controls.  We are now completing interviews with relatives who had not previously participated in the study. During the past year, we have continued to recruit new probands and family members.  We are also following up the original sample, repeating interviews, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), actigraphy, and clinic measures, to assess the stability of these measures over time and track their relationship with emerging mental and medical illness in probands and family members, especially offspring.  We have completed collection and genotyping of DNA samples, and we plan to conduct statistical genetic analyses during the coming year. We have completed analyses of the clinical validity of our interview, Diagnostic Interview for Affective and Anxiety Spectrum (DIAS), as compared to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID), (Nakamura et al, in preparation). Results showed overall good concordance between the SCID and DIAS, with the DIAS frequently eliciting more information especially in regards to anxiety disorders.We have conducted extensive analyses of the clinical and biomarker phenotypes of familial aggregation data during the past year. We have also investigated comorbidity and co-aggregation of mood disorder subtypes with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), insomnia, cardiovascular risk factors, chronotype, and temperament (Iorfino et al, under review). Findings indicated that temperamental traits tapping anxiety are highly familial, but these traits do not appear to constitute manifestations of the same underlying diathesis as anxiety and mood disorders. Likewise, we found that ADHD does not appear to share a common underlying diathesis with bipolar disorder (BPD), whereas insomnia may reflect a common risk factors underlying mania and atypical depression. We have also devoted substantial effort to harmonize the measures and data sets from the Lausanne Family Study with the NIMH Family Study and plan to conduct joint analyses of the data on youth. We have analyzed joint data on comorbidity and co-aggregation of suicide and mental disorders, and shown that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with suicide attempts in families (Ballard et al, submitted).   We have nearly completed analyses on additional biomarkers that were collected on both probands and relatives. We found that bipolar 1 (BPI) disorder was characterized by lower average and greater variability in motor activity, and that those with BPD have greater reactivity across homeostatic regulatory systems of activity, sleep, mood and energy (Shou et al, 2017; Scott et al, 2017). Analyses of olfactory thresholds and detection revealed that people with BPI and major depression have deficits in odor identification, particularly attributable to the subgroup with psychotic symptoms (Kamath et al, under revision).Using ecological momentary sampling, we further showed that people with BPD have greater reactivity to positive events, whereas variability in mood and anxiety appears to be a trait marker of people with a history of mood disorders in general (Lamers et al, under review).  We have employed a novel statistical technique to study the stability of emotional and attention states using fragmentation models (Johns et al, under review). We have now developed new EMA scripts that will be used in several sites to increase the generalizability of the samples and the power of these analyses. We are also analyzing sleep patterns and disorders as well as physical activity and their associations with mood disorder subtypes.Although there are no differences between people with mood disorder subtypes on the startle domains, we found that social anxiety is strongly associated with habituation and baseline startle. These startle domains are also highly familial. Therefore, we plan to follow up these findings by extending the sample to include more people with SAD and to recruit more family members.In summary, we have now confirmed with our preliminary analyses that people with BPI disorder differ from those with other subtypes of mood disorders and/or controls in terms of variability of motor activity, rhythms of sleep and activity, greater cross-domain reactivity, and greater autonomic reactivity. People with SAD tend to have greater reactivity to startle than those with mood disorders or controls. The major shift in the emphasis of the study is to follow up the sample to evaluate the stability of the clinical phenomena and potential biomarkers and their association with developmental manifestations of mood disorders and their core components.

Fragmentation as a novel measure of stability in normalized trajectories of mood and attention assessed by electronic diaries.Public Health Impact:Integration of the clinical, neuropsychological and psychophysiological measures within families will render an in-depth analysis of the biological mechanisms crucial for mood and anxiety disorders and their underlying diatheses. This will not only lead to a better understanding of these conditions and assist in identifying common genetic mechanisms, but may also lead to the development of novel treatment options and possible strategies for prevention and early intervention in those with elevated risk for these conditions. Future Plans:The initial findings of our study have major implications for etiology, treatment, course and nosology of mood and anxiety disorders. However, the work requires replication in larger samples, re-assessment to examine stability of the findings, and collaboration with other sites to cover the full range of the spectrum of mood disorders, and increase the power of the study.  We are now working to increase the number of probands with BPD and SAD in the study and are conducting comprehensive examinations of relatives, with a particular focus on youth ages 12-30. We continue to follow up the families already enrolled in the project to examine the stability of findings, re-consent participants for sharing of genetic data, and repeat the mobile technologies measures to examine their fluctuation over time. Based on the findings from study analyses, we plan to design and pilot interventions that stabilize regulation of activity, sleep and other daily rhythms in this and other samples. We also plan to establish a collaborative network of affiliated studies of community, high risk and clinical samples of youth with common measures of mood and motor activity.","actigraphy;Adult;Affective;Age;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;anxiety spectrum disorders;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Atypical depressive disorder;Autonomic nervous system;base;Biological;Biological Factors;Biological Markers;Bipolar Disorder;Bipolar I;blink reflexes;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Physiology;cardiovascular risk factor;Cardiovascular system;Child;Clinic;Clinical;clinical biomarkers;clinical phenotype;cognitive testing;cohort;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;community setting;Comorbidity;computerized;Consent;Data;Data Aggregation;Data Analyses;Data Set;design;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;diaries;Diet;Disease;disease classification;Disease susceptibility;disorder subtype;DNA;Early Intervention;Ecological momentary assessment;Emotional Stability;endophenotype;Enrollment;Etiology;Evaluation;Event;Evolution;Family;Family member;Family Planning;family structure;Family Study;follow-up;Future;Genetic;genetic analysis;genetic epidemiology;Genotype;Goals;habituation;Headache;Heart Rate;high risk;Holter Electrocardiography;Hormones;immune function;Individual;Intervention;Interview;Joints;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Longevity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Major Depressive Disorder;Manic;Measures;Medical;Medical History;Mental disorders;Metabolic;Methods;Migraine;mobile computing;Modeling;Mood Disorders;Moods;Motor Activity;National Institute of Mental Health;Neurologic Examination;Neuropsychology;Nomenclature;novel;Odors;offspring;olfactory threshold;Participant;Patient Self-Report;Pattern;Personality;Persons;Phase;Phenotype;phenotypic biomarker;Physical activity;Physical Examination;potential biomarker;power analysis;Preparation;Preventive Intervention;proband;Protocols documentation;Psyche structure;Psychiatry;Psychology;Psychopathology;Psychophysiology;psychotic symptoms;Public Health;Publications;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Reflex action;Regulation;Research;Resolution;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Running;Salivary;Sampling;Series;Site;Sleep;Sleep Disorders;Sleeplessness;social;social anxiety;Social Anxiety Disorder;Specificity;Stress;Structure;Subgroup;suicidal behavior;Suicide;Suicide attempt;symptom cluster;Symptoms;Syndrome;System;Techniques;Temperament;Testing;Time;trait;transmission process;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Valsalva Maneuver;Work;Youth;","FAMILY STUDY OF AFFECTIVE AND ANXIETY SPECTRUM DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9569195","","",1ZIAMH002804-15,1,ZIA,MH,002804,15,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8174758","MERIKANGAS, KATHLEEN R",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1867498,

We examined the clinical correlates of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) and found that this diagnosis is present among only a small group of adolescents, who often have other psychiatric and neurologic conditions (Althoff et al, 2016).  We also investigated correlates of overweight/obesity (OW/OB) among adolescents with bipolar disorder (BPD), depression, and no mood disorder and found among those with BPD, adolescents with OW/OB were more likely to report suicide attempts, physical or sexual abuse, binge eating or bulimia, and comorbid conduct disorder (Goldstein et al, 2016).  We are also interested in the relationship between sleep patterns and mental health in adolescents and found that youth with suboptimal sleep patterns had higher odds of an array of mental disorders and other health related outcomes. Our findings suggest that interventions to optimize sleep patterns may also benefit adolescent mental health (Zhang et al, 2017).  Finally, in a study investigating the generalizability of clinical trials results for adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD), findings indicated that trials of pharmacological, and to a lesser extent, psychotherapeutic interventions, likely exclude most adolescents with MDD and consideration should be given to balancing eligibility criteria and internal validity with applicability routine clinical care, while ensuring patient safety (Blanco et al, in press).  In collaboration with colleagues at Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, and other institutes at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we completed a study assessing the order of onset between mania and other mental disorders in U.S. adults using data from NESARC. We found that those with mania at Wave 1 had increased risk of both depression and anxiety disorders at Wave 2, while those with depression at Wave 1 had increased risk of both mania and anxiety at Wave 2. These results challenge the traditional coupling of mania and depression and indicate that further research into the links between mania and anxiety is needed (Olfson et al, 2017). In collaboration with our colleagues in Zurich, we published an analysis of the trajectory of mental disorder risk across ages 20 to 50 (Paksarian et al, 2016).  We found that trajectories differed between men and women and that while very few people had persistent mental disorder across the entire age period studied, one trajectory that was consistently identified indicated high risk from the late 20s until the early 40s. In addition, we examined patterns of change in age-of-onset reports among study participants over almost 30 years of study participation. Our findings indicated that there is substantial variability in age-of-onset reports, that reports increase systematically with age, and that there may be variability according to disorder type and clinical correlates (Paksarian et al, 2017).With researchers at UPENN, we evaluated clinical patterns and predictors of symptom persistence with various psychosis spectrum trajectories and outcomes using the PNC data. Our findings of varying courses of psychosis spectrum symptoms in U.S. youth confirm those of earlier studies, and highlight that psychosis risk is a dynamic process in young people (Calkins et al, 2017).  We have also investigated the associations between neurocognitive function with specific mood disorder subgroups and examined familial correlations in neurocognitive function.  Our results indicate there were few differences in neurocognitive function except enhanced accuracy in specific domains among those with bipolar 1 disorder and MDD (Merikangas et al, 2017).We have continued to collaborate with researchers from the COLAUS study in Switzerland. We evaluated to what extent a genetic risk score (GRS) combining multiple genetic risk variants was associated with migraine prevalence, subtypes and severity and found that the GRS was associated with migraine without aura, but not with migraine with aura, suggesting a different genetic susceptibility background underlying the two types of migraine (Pisanu et al, 2017). Additionally, we found that the atypical subtype of MDD at baseline was associated with increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation linked to cardiovascular diseases) at follow-up, whereas inflammation was not a risk factor for subsequent depression (Glaus et al, in press). In a Viewpoint article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, we described challenges to the federal mandate for mental health statistics and lack of coordinated data on serious mental disorders.  We proposed the directions of future studies in getting a comprehensive picture of the burden of mental and substance use disorder in the U.S. (Merikangas et al, 2017).In collaboration with researchers in Denmark, we completed a study that used Danish population registry data to assess whether the well-established association between urbanicity at birth with schizophrenia may be attributable to selective migration among those with greater genetic susceptibility. Our findings indicated that the association could not be attributed to genetic confounding, increasing confidence that the association is causal. This study has important implications for research on environmental risk factors in the etiology of schizophrenia (Paksarian et al, 2017).   Public Health Impact:These studies provide valuable insight into the nature of mental disorders and their burden among children, adolescents, and adults across time. The NCS-A study was the first with comprehensive domains of emotional and behavior disorders in a nationally representative sample of U.S. youth, and the results have had significant public health impact. The PNC is also destined to become a high-impact project because it consists of a large, systematically obtained pediatric sample with enriched information from electronic medical records and direct interviews. Our studies of comorbidity in adolescents and youth, such as that between mental and substance use disorders or between sleep patterns and mental disorders, highlight the potential for identification of opportunities for intervention in adolescent mental health. The Zurich Cohort Study is an extremely valuable data source, as it is the longest community-based longitudinal study in which participants were enrolled at the beginning of adulthood. Lastly, our work on the COLAUS study has substantial potential for public health impact because it combines information regarding cardiovascular risk factors and mental disorders in a longitudinal study. Our recent work represents only the beginning of a research program that we hope will help to tease apart the longitudinal relationships between physical and mental health in the population.Future Plans:We plan to continue to analyze these rich data sources and plan to continue to explore other large population datasets such as the NESARC, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, and the Center for Disease Control's Youth Risk Behavior Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, both within our research group and with collaborators across NIH and at other institutions. We are currently focusing on mental disorders and other health related outcomes in relation to: 1) parenting style, 2) disparities based on race-ethnicity and immigrant status, 3) residential and school mobility, 4) peer and family social network characteristics, 5) lifestyle factors such as physical activity and sleep, 6) familial aggregation and comorbidities within families, and 7) biomarkers and health risk factors.","Adolescent;Adolescent obesity;Adolescent Risk Behavior;Adult;Age;Age of Onset;Alcohols;American Medical Association;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;base;Behavior Disorders;Behavioral;Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System;Binge Eating;Biochemical Genetics;Biological Markers;Bipolar Disorder;Bipolar I;Birth;Bulimia;C-reactive protein;Cardiovascular Diseases;cardiovascular risk factor;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Characteristics;Child;Child Rearing;Childhood;Classic Migraine;Clinical;clinical care;clinical practice;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Common Migraine;Communities;Comorbidity;Computerized Medical Record;Conduct Disorder;Coupling;Data;data registry;Data Set;Data Sources;Denmark;developmental genetics;Diagnosis;Disease;disease classification;disorder risk;Drug usage;Eligibility Determination;Emotional;Emotional disorder;Enrollment;Ensure;Environmental Risk Factor;Epidemiology;epidemiology study;Equilibrium;Ethnic Origin;Etiology;Family;follow-up;Future;Genetic;genetic epidemiology;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Risk;Goals;Health;high risk;Immigrant;Individual;Inflammation;inflammatory marker;insight;Institutes;Institution;interest;Intervention;Interview;Investigation;Journals;lifestyle factors;Link;Longitudinal Studies;Major Depressive Disorder;Manic;men;Mental Depression;mental disorder prevention;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Migraine;migration;Mood Disorders;Moods;National Institute of Mental Health;Nature;Neurocognitive;Neurologic;Obesity;Outcome;Overweight;Participant;patient safety;Pattern;pediatric department;peer;Pennsylvania;Pharmacology;Philadelphia;physical abuse;Physical activity;physical conditioning;Population;population based;Population Heterogeneity;Population Research;Population Study;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Process;programs;Prospective Studies;Psyche structure;Psychotic Disorders;Public Health;Published Comment;Publishing;Race;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Factors;risk variant;Sampling;Schizophrenia;Schools;severe mental illness;severe mood dysregulation;Severities;Sexual abuse;Sleep;Social Network;statistics;study population;Subgroup;Substance Use Disorder;Suicide attempt;Surveys;Switzerland;Symptoms;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Woman;Work;Youth;","POPULATION-BASED EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH",n/a,"NIMH","9569198","","",1ZIAMH002953-02,1,ZIA,MH,002953,02,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8174758","MERIKANGAS, KATHLEEN R",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,622499,
"Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Bipolar Disorder;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Complementary and Alternative Medicine;Depression;Genetics;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Physical Activity;Prevention;Serious Mental Illness;Sleep Research","There is growing interest in studying the environmental, biologic and genetic correlates of the components of motor activity as well as the relationships between motor activity with sleep, exercise, mood, and cognitive functioning. Aggregation of the findings across these studies is complicated by the substantial differences in both the study goals, procedures and statistical methods. There is a need for greater coordination across studies in the procedures and analytic methods that can take into account advances in analysis of functional data.We have devoted the past year to analyses of the findings of the actigraphy and electronic diary, and their combination. We have used multiple analytic approaches to characterize the actigraphy data including generalized estimating equations, mixed models, functional principal components analysis and scalar regression models. We found that bipolar 1 (BPI) disorder was characterized by lower average and greater variability in motor activity, and that those with BPD have greater reactivity across homeostatic regulatory systems of activity, sleep, mood and energy (Shou et al, 2017). We have presented findings at scientific meetings during the past year including the International Society for Bipolar Disorder Research in Washington, DC; the International Society for Affective Disorders in Amsterdam; the Gordon Conference on Cognition and Circadian Rhythms in Hong Kong; the Society for Biological Psychiatry in San Diego, CA; the International Conference on Ambulatory Monitoring of Physical Activity and Movement in Bethesda, MD; the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Hollywood, FL; and several academic settings including Harvard Medical School, Weill-Cornell Medical School, and the University of Toronto.We have also done extensive analyses of the electronic diary data using EMA. A post-baccalaureate training fellow from our group (Yao Xiao, B.S.) has developed a shiny application using R language that facilitates visualization of the data including frequencies, cross tabulation of multiple variables, and preliminary analyses of the data. Our analyses of the data showed that people with BPD have greater reactivity to positive events, whereas variability in mood and anxiety appears to be a trait marker of people with a history of mood disorders in general (Lamers et al, under review).  We have also employed a novel statistical technique to study the stability of emotional and attention states using fragmentation models (Johns et al, under review). We have now developed new EMA scripts that will be used in several sites in order to increase the generalizability of the samples and the power of these analyses. We are also analyzing sleep patterns and disorders as well as physical activity and their associations with mood disorder subtypes.This work has primarily been focused on data from the NIMH Family Study. However, we have also analyzed data from the Brisbane Twin Study and the Australian BMRI. Our analytic group has conducted several webinars that instruct mMARCH site investigators on the procedures for processing, setting up data sets and conducting analyses of the GENEActiv actigraphy data. We have also convened an international team of biostatisticians and mathematicians directed by Drs. Vadim Zipunnikov and Haochang Shou that is working on algorithms for processing and analyzing the actigraphy data. The goal of this group is to simultaneously characterize multiple landmarks in circadian rhythms and will model inter- and intra-day interactions and dynamics in rest/activity and sleep patterns, thereby augmenting the available information and will empower the analytical framework uniformly applied across mMARCH sites.  During the past year, we have had two meetings of the mood disorder work groups that have been involved in planning the analyses and developing new studies using common methods and measures. One of these work groups has written a review of the importance of motor activation as a core feature of BPD, and reviewed the literature on actigraphy in mood disorders (Scott et al, 2017).Publications resulting from the mMARCH initiative:-Shou H, Cui L, Hickie I, Lameira DM, Lamers F, Crainiceanu C, Zipunnikov V, Merikangas K (2017) Dysregulation of objectively-assessed 24-hour motor activity patterns in bipolar disorder.

JAMA Psychiatry 74:189-196.Public Health Impact:The formation of the mMARCH initiative will enable groups to efficiently share and combine data to learn more about how activity affects different disorders and diseases across many populations, including mood disorders, sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, genetic studies, emotion, eating, etc. This work will also define targets for prevention and intervention studies.Future Plans:During the next year we are focusing on three major activities: (1) joint analysis of the mMARCH core group data including the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus study of comorbidity of depression and cardiovascular disease, the NESDA study in the Netherlands, the Australian studies of twin and youth with emerging mood disorders, and the Hong Kong circadian rhythms study; (2) follow up of the NIMH Family Study and the CoLaus/PsyCoLaus samples to investigate the stability of the findings from the first wave of participants; and (3) initiation of new studies of youth in seven sites (miniMARCH collaboration).  For the first goal, we will continue to develop standard methods of analyses for cross-site data, and the topical work groups on mood disorders, sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, developmental trajectories, and genetic studies will establish specific aims and analyze the multi-site data. For the second goal, we have developed new scripts for the EMA data and will examine the stability of the findings by repeated assessments twice per year.  The third goal involves harmonization of clinical and mobile technology procedures in three studies of offspring of parents with BPD (NIMH, Bethesda, MD; Lausanne, Switzerland; Hong Kong, China), three population studies (Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queensland, Australia; Staten Island, NY) and three clinical studies of youth (Toronto, Canada; Philadelphia, PA; Sydney, Australia). We are starting to have regular meetings of the latter sites to discuss common aims, measures and procedures. The goal of these studies is to identify the longitudinal evolution of patterns of motor activity / sleep and their relationships with mood and comorbid conditions.","Academic Medical Centers;actigraphy;Address;Adolescent;Affect;Affective;Algorithms;Ambulatory Monitoring;American;analytical method;Anxiety;anxiety spectrum disorders;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Australia;Biological Psychiatry;Biometry;Bipolar Disorder;Bipolar I;brain research;Brazil;Canada;Cardiovascular Diseases;China;Circadian Rhythms;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cognition;cognitive function;Collaborations;Collection;college;comorbid depression;Comorbidity;Data;Data Analyses;data management;Data Set;data visualization;Development;developmental genetics;Devices;diaries;Disease;disorder subtype;Doctor of Philosophy;Eating;Ecological momentary assessment;Emotional Stability;Emotions;Equation;Event;Evolution;Exercise;Family Study;follow-up;Frequencies;Future;Genetic;genetic epidemiology;genetic risk factor;Genetic study;Goals;Health;Hong Kong;Hour;Human;interest;International;Intervention Studies;Island;Joints;Language;Learning;Measures;medical schools;meetings;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Methods;Mind-Body Method;mobile computing;Modeling;Mood Disorders;Moods;Motor;Motor Activity;Movement;National Institute of Mental Health;Netherlands;neuropsychopharmacology;novel;offspring;Paper;Parents;Participant;Pattern;Philadelphia;Physical activity;physical conditioning;Population;Population Study;power analysis;Preventive Intervention;Principal Component Analysis;Procedures;Psychiatry;Public Health;Public Health Schools;Publications;Queensland;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Activity;Research Institute;Research Personnel;Rest;Review Literature;Sampling;Site;Sleep;Societies;Standardization;Statistical Methods;Subgroup;Substance abuse problem;Switzerland;symposium;System;systematic review;Techniques;Technology;Training;trait;Twin Multiple Birth;Twin Studies;Universities;Washington;webinar;Work;working group;Youth;","MOTOR ACTIVITY RESEARCH CONSORTIUM FOR HEALTH (MMARCH)",n/a,"NIMH","9569199","","",1ZIAMH002954-02,1,ZIA,MH,002954,02,,Unavailable,"","","",,"8174758","MERIKANGAS, KATHLEEN R",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,622499,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences","During the past year, we have focused on 1) characterizing the representation of stimulus features in primary visual cortex, and 2) studying how these representations interact with endogenous brain states, such as spatial attention and arousal.1) Characterizing stimulus representations in human visual cortex. Stimulus orientation is one of the most basic stimulus features represented in primary visual cortex (V1). Yet, after more than 50 years of research, the representation of orientation is inadequately understood. Orientation-selective V1 neurons are organized at a fine spatial scale in a pseudo-periodic, columnar structure across the cortical surface. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have previously discovered an additional level of organization, a coarse-scale orientation bias in which each fMRI voxel in V1 exhibits an orientation preference that depends on the region of space that it represents.Over the past year, we have investigated the neural computations that give rise to the coarse-scale orientation bias. We developed a computational model of neural activity in V1. The modeling results indicate that three theoretically distinct neural mechanisms could give rise to the coarse-scale orientation bias: contextual modulation, neural gain fields, and asymmetric surround suppression.We tested predictions of the theoretical model using high-resolution fMRI at 7 Tesla (7T) under NCT00001360. We found that orientation selectivity is strongly influenced by contextual factors, such as contrast changes at the boundary of the stimulus. Our results have implications for the neural processing of natural scenes. We are now applying these theoretical and empirical findings to guide studies of visual recovery following stroke. Our work on understanding neural computations in the intact visual system is vital in determining how these computations are altered in mental health and neurological disorders.2) Endogenous brain states.Visual perception arises from dynamic interactions between feedforward sensory information and top-down modulatory signals. In the past year, we have studied two types of top-down modulation. First, we used a novel spatial cuing protocol to isolate fMRI activity associated with endogenous spatial attention. We discovered specific sub-regions of the temporal-parietal junction are involved in directing attention to locations in space.Second, we identified a type of brain activity that reflects the subject's general engagement in a task. This task-related activity contributes prominently to brain hemodynamic responses measured with fMRI, is independent of external visual stimuli, and instead reflects internal brain states. Task-related activity appears to be distinct from spatially-localized endogenous attention. Rather, it may be related to general arousal. We are now testing the hypothesis that fluctuations in task-related brain activity predict fluctuations in behavioral performance. Our experiments in the past year have focused on simple visual discrimination tasks. However, we are planning to extend these experiments to investigate the relationship between task-related activity and reward processing and response conflict. Understanding the neural mechanisms of attention and global brain states has implications for the study of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).","area striata;Arousal;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Autistic Disorder;Behavioral;Brain;Computer Analysis;Computer Simulation;Conflict (Psychology);contextual factors;directed attention;Discrimination;Exhibits;experimental study;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;hemodynamics;Human;Link;Location;Measurement;Measures;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Modeling;nervous system disorder;neural model;neuromechanism;novel;orientation selectivity;Parietal;Perception;Performance;Periodicity;Protocols documentation;Psychophysics;Recovery;relating to nervous system;Research;Resolution;response;reward processing;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;Stroke;Structure;Surface;Testing;Theoretical model;V1 neuron;Visual;Visual Cortex;Visual Perception;visual stimulus;Visual system structure;Work;","MULTIPLE SCALES OF STIMULUS REPRESENTATION IN THE HUMAN BRAIN",n/a,"NIMH","9589765","","",1ZIAMH002966-01,1,ZIA,MH,002966,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15265881","MERRIAM, ELISHA ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,198245,
"Acquired Cognitive Impairment;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Cardiovascular;Clinical Research;Congenital Heart Disease;Congenital Structural Anomalies;Heart Disease;Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Rare Diseases","The essential circuit for both item and associative stimulus recognition in any given sensory modality consists of the relevant cortical sensory processing stream(s), the medial temporal rhinal cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Context-free recall, familiarity based recognition, or fact memory, seems to depend primarily on the above basic memory circuit. Associative recall, recollection-based recognition, or event memory, seems to depend in addition on a higher-order circuit superimposed on the basic one and consisting of the hippocampus, mammillary body, and anterior thalamic nuclei. Several years ago we discovered that hypoxic/ischemic events sustained within the first year of life may result in a form of amnesia. This 'developmental amnesia' (DA) is characterized by markedly impaired episodic (or event) memory combined with relative preservation of both semantic (or fact) memory and familiarity-based recognition memory, and is associated with medial temporal pathology restricted to the hippocampus. Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is the second most common chronic heart disease in early infancy. As a result, infants often suffer significant cyanosis at birth and are at risk of HI damage prior to and during corrective surgery. The hippocampus is particularly sensitive to HI insults during development, therefore we studied the effects of early HI on hippocampal structure and function in infants with TGA. We examined neonates who had surgery for TGA shortly after birth and a group of normally developing controls. Age corrected mean hippocampal volumes were shown to be significantly smaller in the TGA group compared to normal controls. Controls demonstrated a significant novelty preference in contrast to infants with TGA who did not. Larger mean hippocampal volumes were associated with stronger novelty preference across all subjects, albeit, this association was particularly strong in the TGA cohort. This study provides important new information giving us insight into the cascade of events that lead to a profile of compromised hippocampal volumes and memory impairments in middle childhood in patients with TGA.  In addition, it provides support to the idea that the hippocampus contributes to the detection of novelty from an early age. In DA subjects despite the systemic impact of HI, the resulting brain damage is largely limited to the hippocampus. However, the thalamus and the mammillary bodies are parts of the hippocampal-diencephalic network and are therefore also at risk of injury following HI events. We therefore conducted a neuroimaging investigation of diencephalic damage in a group of 18 patients with DA (age range 11-35 years), and an equal number of controls. Importantly, we uncovered a marked degree of atrophy in the mammillary bodies in two thirds of our patients. In addition, as a group, patients had mildly reduced thalamic volumes. The size of the anterior-mid thalamic segment was correlated with patients' visual memory performance. Thus, in addition to the hippocampus, diencephalic structures also appear to play a role in the patients' memory deficit.Recollection involves bringing back to mind a prior event, including the sights and sounds associatedwith that experience. Patients with DA show a deficit in recollection such that they are not able to recall unique experiences, yet are able to generalise across multiple similar events. It is possible that some contextual information is retrieved in DA at a level which is insufficient to support recall, but sufficient for a decontextualized representation of the event. To test this hypothesis, we investigated context reinstatement in patients with DA. On each encoding trial, a word was overlaid on an image and presented on the left, center, or right side of the visual field. The background images were rural,urban and scrambled scenes. Two memory tasks were conducted during fMRI. In the Backgroundtask, participants were instructed to remember the image that accompanied each word, whereas inthe Location task, they had to remember the location in which each word was presented. Behaviorally, all controls performed above chance, whereas patients performed at chance levels.  fMRI data in the controls showed the typical pattern of scene reinstatement, such that words that were previously paired with scenes were associated with greater activity in the parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices than words paired with scrambled scenes. Interestingly, patients also showed scene reinstatement effects, but these were localized in the visual cortex, and not the regions that are typically associated with scene memory. For both groups, scene reinstatement effects were present in the Background Task, but not in the Location Task, suggesting that reinstatement is dependent on the retrieval goal. A functional localizer indicated that scene processing engaged the same regions in both groups. These data indicate that DA patients are able to reinstate aspects of their prior experience (i.e. visual context) in a strategically-directed way, but that this reinstatement is qualitatively different from that of controls and is insufficient to support context-dependent memory responses. We conclude that limited sub-threshold context memory processes occur in DA, despite the profound impairment in recollection.Across species, perhaps the most well-established contribution of the hippocampus to memory is not to episodic or recollection memory but to allocentric spatial memory. We investigated the effect of hippocampal lesions on allocentric spatial navigational memory in monkeys using a virtual environment. The task, a variant of the Morris Water Maze, which has been used extensively to test navigational spatial memory in rodents, required monkeys to use a joystick to navigate to a rewarded location within a circular arena. This circular arena resided in a larger hexagonal room, with six unique images at the walls of the room providing cues for orientation. The orientation cues, as well as the rewarded location within the arena, were different on each testing day, thus providing a different allocentric spatial memory problem in each session. In each trial, monkeys started navigating from a random location within the circular arena. Performance was assessed as the ratio between the distance traveled and the optimal distance, given each trial's starting location. To our surprise, neither learning rate nor ceiling performance was significantly reduced after bilateral lesions of the hippocampus. The results thus suggest that the integrity of the hippocampus in rhesus monkeys may not be critical for memory-based allocentric spatial navigation in this virtual reality environment.","Address;Age;Aging;Alzheimer's Disease;Amnesia;Anterior;Anterior Nuclear Group;Atrophic;Back;base;Behavioral;Bilateral;Biological Preservation;Birth;Body part;Brain Injuries;Cerebrum;Characteristics;Child;Child health care;Chronic;Cognitive;cohort;Collaborations;college;Corpus striatum structure;Cues;Cyanosis;Data;Detection;Development;Electrophysiology (science);Environment;Episodic memory;Event;experience;extrastriate visual cortex;Familiarity;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;habit learning;Heart Diseases;Hippocampus (Brain);Hypoxia;Image;Impairment;infancy;Infant;Injury;insight;Institutes;Investigation;Joystick;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Left;Lesion;Life;Location;London;Macaca mulatta;Medial;Medial Dorsal Nucleus;Mediating;Memory;Memory impairment;memory process;memory recognition;Metabolic;Methods;middle childhood;Mind;Modality;Monkeys;morris water maze;multidisciplinary;neonate;Neurobiology;neuroimaging;Neurologic;neuromechanism;nonhuman primate;Operative Surgical Procedures;Participant;Pathology;Patients;Pattern;Pediatric Hospitals;Performance;Perinatal;Pharmacology;Play;preference;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;professor;relating to nervous system;Research;response;Retrieval;Rewards;Risk;Rodent;Role;Rural;Schizophrenia;Semantics;Sensory;Side;sound;spatial memory;Stimulus;Stream;Structure;Syndrome;System;Techniques;Testing;Thalamic structure;Transposition of Great Vessels;Travel;Universities;Variant;virtual reality;Vision;Visual;Visual Cortex;Visual Fields;visual memory;way finding;Work;","NEURAL MECHANISMS OF LEARNING AND MEMORY IN VISION",n/a,"NIMH","9568238","","",1ZIAMH000478-61,1,ZIA,MH,000478,61,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6571717","MISHKIN, MORTIMER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,276923,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","Several diverse pieces of evidence suggest the possibility that auditory long-term memory may require the the oromotor system. The first set of findings comes from a series of studies carried out on the KE family, half of whose members suffer from an inherited speech and language disorder. The core deficit is in executing orofacial, especially articulatory, movements as a result of a mutation of the FOXP2 gene. The second line of evidence is monkeys are easily able to store visual and other sensory stimuli in long term memory, but are unable to do so with auditory stimuli. Although seemingly unrelated, these pieces of evidence from the human and animal studies suggest the following proposal. Because natural acoustic stimuli such as speech sounds fluctuate rapidly in time, it may be that their neural representations cannot be packaged for long-term storage in the sensory system alone, because the sensory system may not contain an integration time-window that is long enough to represent the full duration of the fluctuating stimulus. Consequently, packaging of such stimuli may require the aid of the oromotor system, which is uniquely organized to chain-link rapid sequences. The neural phenotype of this FOXP2 mutation is primarily characterized by a pronounced volume reduction in the caudate nucleus bilaterally. Since both speech and grammar involve the implicit acquisition of structured sequences, the developmental verbal/orofacial dyspraxia in the affected KE members may extend to impaired grammar learning. To determine whether the structurally abnormal cortico-striatal circuitry of KE members is associated with deficits in implicit acquisition of abstract combinatorial rules, we conducted an fMRI study of artificial grammar learning (AGL). Members of the KE family and controls subjects were trained on an auditory-verbal version of a finite-state grammar and made grammatical classifications on new words during fMRI. Control subjects performed above chance endorsing grammatical more frequently than ungrammatical words and low-similarity items more frequently than high-similarity ones. KE family subjects performed at chance-level, significantly worse than controls, showing reduced Grammaticality but not Similarity effects on endorsement rates. For controls subjects, Grammaticality-related fMRI activations were found in the superior occipital gyri and dorsal striatum; Similarity-related activations activations were seen in the right supramarginal gyrus and left posterior HVIIa Crus I/II.  In contrast KE members showed hypoactivations for Grammaticality-related effects in right superior temporal gyrus, left supplementary motor area, bilateral central operculum/anterior insula, left paravermal HVI/HVIIa Crus I and HVIII; no functional abnormalities were observed for Similarity effects. KE subjects showed compromised implicit AGL and associated hypoactivation in structures fundamental to speech processing. Our results support the proposal that the cortico-striatal structural/functional abnormalities of the KE members give rise to a series of impairments that stem from, but go beyond the acquisition of articulate speech and impede the implicit acquisition of verbal structure. The combined behavioral-neural phenotype of KE members is consistent with deficits in the cortico-striatal habit system. While monkeys easily acquire the rules for performing visual and tactile recognition memory, they have extraordinary difficulty acquiring a similar rule in audition. Another striking difference between the modalities is that whereas bilateral ablation of the rhinal cortex (RhC) leads to profound impairment in visual and tactile recognition, the same lesion has no effect on auditory recognition memory. In our previous study, a mild impairment in auditory memory was obtained following bilateral ablation of the entire medial temporal lobe (MTL), including the RhC, and an equally mild effect was observed after bilateral ablation of the auditory cortical areas in the rostral superior temporal gyrus (rSTG). Neural correlates for recognition memory have been observed throughout the auditory and prefrontal cortex, defining a network of areas supporting auditory STM with parallels to that supporting visual STM.  In order to test the hypothesis that each of the mild impairments observed was due to partial disconnection of acoustic input with the frontal cortex we examined the effects of a more complete auditory disconnection by combining the removals of both the rSTG and the RhC. We found that the combined lesion led to forgetting thresholds that fell precipitously from the normal retention duration of 30 to 40s to a duration of only 1 to 2s, thus nearly abolishing auditory recognition memory, and leaving behind only a residual echoic memory. In the primate auditory cortex, information flows serially in the mediolateral dimension from core, to belt, to parabelt. In the caudorostral dimension, stepwise serial projections convey information through the primary, rostral, and rostrotemporal (AI, R, and RT) core areas on the supratemporal plane, continuing to the rostrotemporal polar area (RTp) and the temporal pole. In addition to this cascade of corticocortical connections, the auditory cortex receives parallel thalamocortical projections from the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Previous studies have examined the projections from MGN to auditory cortex, but most have focused on the caudal core areas AI and R. We investigated the full extent of connections between MGN and AI, R, RT, RTp, and rSTG. Both AI and R received nearly 90% of their thalamic inputs from the ventral subdivision of the MGN (MGv; the primary/lemniscal auditory pathway). By contrast, RT receives only 45% from MGv, and an equal share from the dorsal subdivision (MGd). Area RTp receives 25% of its inputs from MGv, with additional inputs from multisensory areas outside the MGN. The MGN input to RTp distinguished this rostral extension of auditory cortex from the adjacent auditory-related cortex of the rSTG, which received 80% of its thalamic input from multisensory nuclei (primarily medial pulvinar). We identified complementary descending connections by which highly processed auditory information may modulate thalamocortical inputs.  In accord with the laminar patterns evident in corticocortical connections these thalamocortical connections support a model in which AI and R lie at the same hierarchical level, but RT and RTp lie at a higher level, perhaps between that of the core and belt. These results demonstrate an expanded hierarchical model with a complexity which may well exceed the complexity of the primates ventral visual stream.","Ablation;Acoustics;Affect;Animals;Anterior;Apraxias;Area;Auditory;Auditory area;auditory pathway;auditory processing;auditory stimulus;Behavioral;Bilateral;Brain;Brain Injuries;caudate nucleus;Cell Nucleus;Cerebrum;Child;Child health care;Classification;cognitive function;cognitive neuroscience;Collaborations;college;combinatorial;Corpus striatum structure;Development;Dimensions;Discrimination Learning;Dorsal;Electrophysiology (science);Employee Strikes;Excision;experimental study;Family;follow-up;forgetting;FOXP2 gene;frontal lobe;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Geniculate body structure;Goals;Habits;Head;Human;Impairment;Inherited;insight;Institutes;Insula of Reil;Laboratories;Language;Language Development;Language Disorders;Learning;Left;Lesion;Link;London;long term memory;Medial;Mediating;member;Memory;memory recognition;Metabolic;Methods;Modality;Modeling;Monkeys;Motor;Movement;multidisciplinary;multisensory;Mutation;neural correlate;Neurobiology;neuroimaging;neuromechanism;Oral;orofacial;Outcome;Participant;Pattern;Pediatric Hospitals;Perception;Phenotype;Prefrontal Cortex;Primates;Process;professor;Pulvinar structure;relating to nervous system;Research;Residual state;Rest;Rules of conduct;Sensory;sensory stimulus;sensory system;Series;Short-Term Memory;Speech;Speech Disorders;speech processing;Speech Sound;stem;Stimulus;stimulus processing;Stream;Structural defect;Structure;Structure of supramarginal gyrus;Superior temporal gyrus;System;Tactile;Techniques;Temporal Lobe;Testing;Thalamic structure;Time;Training;Universities;Verbal Learning;Vision;Visual;visual memory;Work;","NEURAL MECHANISMS OF LEARNING AND MEMORY IN AUDITION",n/a,"NIMH","9568241","","",1ZIAMH001101-26,1,ZIA,MH,001101,26,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6571717","MISHKIN, MORTIMER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,276923,
"Acquired Cognitive Impairment;Aging;Alzheimer's Disease;Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD);Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biotechnology;Brain Disorders;Dementia;Mental Health;Neurodegenerative;Neurosciences","The memory impairment associated with Alzheimers disease has long been associated with a loss in acetylcholine function and pathophysiology of the entorhinal/perirhinal, or rhinal cortex. In monkeys, lesions of this region as well as cholinergic deafferentation lead to severe memory deficits. We recently compared the effects of selective infusion of the (cholinergic receptor) m1 antagonist pirenzepine, and the m2 antagonist methoctramine directly into the rhinal cortex. Our findings suggest that m1 and m2 receptor subtypes in the perirhinal cortex have functionally dissociable roles, and that visual recognition memory is critically dependent on the m1 receptor subtype.  To examine more about the m1 muscarinic-dependent intracellular signaling pathways that underlie critical synaptic changes important for memory we used a proteomics approach to uncover the molecular signaling pathways activated during memory formation in a region-specific manner using two techniques: laser capture microdissection and reverse phase protein microarrays. Sections of snap-frozen perirhinal tissue from Rhesus monkeys were prepared and stained for Nissl substance. Tissue subregions of perirhinal cortex (Layers III and V/VI), as well as hippocampus (cell body layers of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus and their corresponding dendritic fields), were isolated using laser capture microdissection. Lysed tissue samples were then printed onto reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA). These arrays were probed with antibodies against phosphorylated, as well as total, proteins involved in muscarinic signaling, synaptic transmission, and neuronal activity.  We focused on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1AChR) and the mechanistic target rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways to determine the baseline biological variability of the phosphoprotein signature within monkey brain cortical layers. The ventral portion of the anterior TE (TEav), the perirhinal cortex (PRh), the entorhinal cortex (ERh) and the rostral hippocampus (HF) were dissected from both hemispheres of four rhesus monkeys, and key laminae of TEav, PRh, and ERh, as well as key strata of HF within each subregion, were microdissected using laser capture microdissection. Phosphoprotein and total protein levels of 19 endpoints within the m1AChR or mTOR signaling pathways were quantified using reverse phase protein microarrays.Comparing the variability of phosphoprotein levels between (a) the local microenvironment at the mid rostro-caudal level of the PRh within a single monkey, (b) along the rostro-caudal axis of the PRh within a single monkey, and (c) at the mid rostro-caudal level of the PRh between monkeys, revealed a different pattern for the m1AChR signaling pathway compared to mTOR signaling. As expected, m1AChR pathway signaling variability increased step-wise from the local mid-PRh microenvironment to the entire  PRh between monkeys. In contrast, mTOR signaling showed a significantly higher variability that did not follow the same pattern, with only a slight increase of variability across monkeys compared to within monkey PRh.Memory formation and retrieval depends on the translaminar and layer-specific inter-area flow of information within a highly complex neural network. We therefore wanted to establish whether baseline m1AChR and mTOR signaling differed between individual layers of the cortical subregions of visual association area TE and the perirhinal cortex. Overall, m1AChR pathway activation was not different between individual layers within anterior TEav, perirhinal cortex or the entorhinal cortex. However, mTOR pathway activation was increased in PRh layers 5/6 compared to layer 3. In addition, mTOR signaling was increased in ERh layers 2/3 versus layers 5/6. Interestingly, this complements the known anatomical connections, where PRh layers 5/6 feed into ERh layers 2/3. Using the workflow we established, we were able to quantify mTOR and m1AChR signaling pathway activation within specific laminae of the monkey PRh, as well as critical brain regions feeding into PRh (area TEav) and those receiving input from the PRh (ERh and hippocampus). The pattern of mTOR pathway activation followed the physiologic route of neuronal signaling between the PRh and the ERh. This sets the stage to determine the role of key cell signaling pathways on visual recognition memory in behaviorally trained non-human primates.This project has now been terminated.","Acetylcholine;Address;Aging;Alzheimer's Disease;Anatomy;Anterior;Antibodies;Area;Auditory;Behavioral;Biological;Biological Neural Networks;Brain;Brain Injuries;Brain region;Cells;Cerebrum;Characteristics;Child;cholinergic;Cholinergic Receptors;Complement;Complex;Corpus striatum structure;Deafferentation procedure;dentate gyrus;Dopamine;Electrophysiology (science);entorhinal cortex;extrastriate visual cortex;feeding;FRAP1 gene;Freezing;Functional disorder;Habits;Hippocampus (Brain);Individual;Infusion procedures;laser capture microdissection;Lead;Learning;Lesion;Macaca mulatta;Memory;Memory impairment;memory process;memory recognition;Metabolic;methoctramine;Methods;Molecular;Monkeys;multidisciplinary;Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor;Muscarinic M1 Receptor;Muscarinic M2 Receptor;Muscarinics;Neurobiology;neurochemistry;neuroimaging;Neurologic;Neuromodulator;Neurons;neurotransmission;nonhuman primate;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pharmacology;Phase;Phosphoproteins;Physiological;Pirenzepine;Protein Array;Protein Microchips;Proteins;Proteomics;Research;Retrieval;Role;Route;Schizophrenia;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Staining method;Stains;Stimulus;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission;System;Techniques;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Training;Visual;visual memory;Work;","PHARMACOLOGY OF STIMULUS MEMORY AND HABIT FORMATION",n/a,"NIMH","9568243","","",1ZIAMH002039-35,1,ZIA,MH,002039,35,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6571717","MISHKIN, MORTIMER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,276757,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Mental Health;Neurosciences","The prevailing model of amnesia holds that it depends on damage to a group of loosely related structures, collectively called the medial temporal lobe (MTL). One influential theory holds that these areas work together as a single functional unit. According to this theory, the structures in the MTL store the memory of specific objects, facts and events. We have developed a competing hypothesis, which holds that different structures within the MTL have specialized functions, and that their collective functions extend beyond those assigned to the MTL by the prevailing model.In the last year we investigated the neural underpinnings of stimulus recognition memory. Specifically, we investigated the contribution of the amygdala, a structure in the medial temporal lobe, to this ability. Dual-process accounts of stimulus recognition posit two memory processes: slow but detailed recollection, and quick but vague familiarity. It has been proposed, based on prior rodent work, that the amygdala is critical for the familiarity aspect of item recognition. Here, we evaluated this proposal in animals with selective bilateral excitotoxic amygdala damage. We used a variety of visual memory tests designed to assess different aspects of familiarity, all administered on touchscreen computers. Specifically, we assessed animals tendencies to make low-latency false alarms, to make false alarms to recently-seen lures, to produce curvilinear ROC curves, and to discriminate stimuli based on repetition across days. Across these metrics, monkeys with selective amygdala damage performed like unoperated control monkeys. However, amygdala damage did produce an anticipated deficit in rapid stimulus-reward learning in a three-arm-bandit gambling task, verifying the effectiveness of the lesions. Together, these results contradict prior rodent work and suggest that the amygdala is not critical for the familiarity aspect of item recognition.","Amnesia;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Area;arm;base;Bilateral;Brain;Computers;design;Effectiveness;Episodic memory;Event;excitotoxicity;Familiarity;Feeling;frontal lobe;Gambling;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Influentials;Knowledge;Learning;Lesion;Life;Life Experience;long term memory;Medial;Memory;Memory impairment;memory process;memory recognition;Modeling;Monkeys;Patients;Perceptual learning;Process;relating to nervous system;Rewards;ROC Curve;Rodent;Semantic memory;Severities;Short-Term Memory;skills;Stimulus;Structure;Temporal Lobe;Testing;Thalamic structure;theories;touchscreen;visual memory;Work;","NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF STIMULUS RECOGNITION AND ASSOCIATION MEMORY",n/a,"NIMH","9568249","","",1ZIAMH002736-22,1,ZIA,MH,002736,22,,Unavailable,"","","",,"1905955","MURRAY, ELISABETH A",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,609046,
"Anxiety Disorders;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences;Nutrition","The amygdala, OFC and MFC contribute to learning, in part, by evaluating feedback. In an effort to extend our understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying affective processing, we developed an fMRI paradigm to reveal blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses to visual images that signal reward. Each week, subjects learned to associate images of novel objects with a high or low probability of water reward. Areas responding to the value of recently learned reward-predictive images included MFC area 10m/32, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex area 12, and inferior temporal visual cortex (IT). The amygdala and OFC, each thought to be involved in value encoding, showed little such effect. Instead, these two areas primarily responded to visual stimulation and reward receipt, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the importance of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, MFC, and IT in representing the values of recently learned visual images. Tastes and their associated values drive food consumption and influence choice behavior. To understand the neural mechanisms underlying reward-guided decision making and value learning, we characterized the gustatory system in subjects with fMRI while measuring licking to control for oral movements, and to assess preferences. To identify taste-responsive cortex, we delivered small quantities of sucrose, citric acid, or distilled water in random order without any predictive cues (e.g., visual stimuli) to subjects while using event-related fMRI. In addition, we used an MRI-compatible lick sensor to measure subjects licking during the scans. fMRI signals associated with licking in the absence of fluid delivery were used to mask responses to fluid delivery/receipt and associated licking. Licking in the absence of fluid delivery and fluid receipt times for each tastant were incorporated into a general linear model to analyze fMRI data. By contrasting BOLD responses to sweet and sour tastes with those from distilled water, we identified taste responses in primary gustatory cortex area G, an adjacent portion of the anterior granular and dysgranular insular cortex, and area 12o. Choice tests run outside the scanner revealed that all three monkeys strongly preferred sucrose over citric acid or water. BOLD responses in the ventral striatum and amygdala reflected monkeys preferences, with greater BOLD responses to sucrose than citric acid. Finally, we examined the influence of hydration level by contrasting BOLD responses to receipt of fluids when monkeys were thirsty and after ad libitum water consumption. BOLD responses in area G and area 12o in the left hemisphere were greater following full hydration. By contrast, BOLD responses in portions of medial frontal cortex were reduced after ad libitum water consumption. These findings highlight brain regions involved in representing taste, taste preference and the motivational aspects of tastes.  Increasingly, changes in pupil size are being used as an index of affective state. Under appropriate conditions, pupil size can be correlated with behavioral events with good temporal resolution, making it a useful measure of learning. To probe the contribution of OFC to learning, we trained intact animals and those with OFC lesions on Pavlovian trace conditioning of stimulus-reward associations. The visually presented conditioned stimulus (CS+) was followed by a fluid reward delivered 500 ms after the stimulus was turned off. The CS was followed by an unfilled interval and no reward was delivered. Pupil size was measured with an eye-tracking device. Controls exhibited an increased pupil size to the CS+, compared to the response to the CS-, within a couple of training sessions (mean = 2) and continued to show the conditioned pupil response in anticipation of reward across at least 4 consecutive sessions. By contrast, animals with OFC lesions required more sessions (mean = 14 sessions) to acquire the conditioned autonomic response and three out of four failed to sustain it for 4 consecutive sessions even with an extended period of training (48 sessions on average). We conclude that the OFC is necessary for learning Pavlovian autonomic responses to cues that predict positive events.An earlier study showed that amygdala inputs made a significant contribution to the stimulus-outcome coding of neurons in OFC. In that study, subjects learned a small set of stimulus-reward associations. When these associations were well learned, and highly familiar, neuronal activity was recorded in OFC. In a follow up study, we recorded from OFC neurons while subjects were engaged in learning of stimulus-outcome associations. As before, subjects performed a task that required them to evaluate two stimuli and then choose one to receive the reward associated with that option. Four main findings emerged. First, amygdala lesions slowed the acquisition and use of stimulus-reward associations. Further analyses indicated that this impairment was due, at least in part, to ineffective use of negative feedback to guide subsequent decisions. Second, the activity of neurons in OFC and MFC rapidly evolved to encode the amount of reward associated with each stimulus. Third, amygdala removal reduced the encoding of stimulus-reward associations during the evaluation of different stimuli. Reward encoding of anticipated and received reward after choices were made was not altered. Fourth, amygdala lesions led to an increase in the proportion of neurons in MFC, but not OFC, that encoded the instrumental response that monkeys made on each trial. These correlated changes in behavior and neural activity following amygdala lesions strongly suggest that the amygdala contributes to the ability to rapidly learn stimulus-reward associations through shaping encoding within OFC and MFC.","Achievement;Affective;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Anterior;Anxiety Disorders;Area;base;Behavior;Behavioral;blood oxygen level dependent;Brain;Brain region;Choice Behavior;Citric Acid;Code;Conditioned Stimulus;conditioning;Cues;Data;Decision Making;Devices;Emotional;Emotions;Evaluation;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Eye;Feedback;Follow-Up Studies;food consumption;frontal lobe;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Goals;Hydration status;Image;Impairment;improved;indexing;Inferior;Learning;Left;Lesion;Linear Models;Liquid substance;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Major Depressive Disorder;Masks;Measures;Medial;Mental disorders;Methods;Monkeys;Mood Disorders;Motivation;Movement;neuromechanism;Neurons;neurophysiology;Neuropsychology;novel;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Oral;Outcome;Panic Attack;Photic Stimulation;Physiological;Play;preference;Prefrontal Cortex;Probability;Process;Pupil;Reaction;relating to nervous system;response;reward anticipation;reward processing;Rewards;Role;Running;Scanning;sensor;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;Study Subject;Sucrose;Syndrome;Taste Perception;Taste preferences;taste system;temporal measurement;Testing;theories;Time;Training;Ventral Striatum;Visual;Visual Cortex;visual stimulus;Water;Water consumption;","NEURAL MECHANISMS OF REWARD PROCESSING AND EMOTION",n/a,"NIMH","9568268","","",1ZIAMH002886-11,1,ZIA,MH,002886,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"1905955","MURRAY, ELISABETH A",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,609046,
"Anxiety Disorders;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Depression;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences;Serious Mental Illness","OFC is thought to be essential for at least two aspects of stimulus-reward learning: 1) representing the current value of anticipated outcomes and 2) learning to choose based on the relationship between particular choices and the probability of receiving a reward. These two aspects might be considered to reflect the desirability and availability of reward outcomes. Yet the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a region adjacent to OFC, has also been implicated in learning about the availability of outcomes. To explore the functional specializations of these two frontal cortex regions, we trained animals on two tasks: one required updating representations of a predicted outcomes desirability, as measured by the devaluation task; the other required updating representations of an outcomes availability, as indexed by performance on a probabilistic 3-choice visual discrimination. We evaluated performance on both tasks in three groups of animals: unoperated controls and those with selective, fiber-sparing lesions of either OFC or VLPFC. We found that VLPFC but not OFC plays an essential role in making choices based on outcome availability; in contrast, OFC but not VLPFC is essential for making choices based on outcome desirability. The separate processing of outcome availability and desirability in VLPFC and OFC, respectively, has implications for models of prefrontal cortex function during choice behavior.A considerable body of evidence suggests a role for the amygdala in processing emotionally salient information in faces. For example, patients with amygdala damage fix their gaze on the eye region of faces to a lesser extent than controls. In our earlier work we used an attentional capture task to assess the role of the amygdala in attending to different aspects of facial expressions of emotion. Attentional capture is a phenomenon whereby irrelevant stimuli in the field of view detract from ongoing cognitive processes. We found that subjects with amygdala lesions showed reduced attentional capture by face stimuli, and that this effect was driven by the mouth region more than the eyes. Thus, the amygdala contributes to the processing of, and attention to, certain social cues.Rewarded stimuli are also known to capture attention. Because the amygdala is essential for processing reward outcomes, this raised the possibility that it is important for attending to rewarded stimuli. To test this, animals with amygdala lesions and intact controls were trained to acquire stimulus-reward associations, and then probed for attentional capture by those rewarded stimuli. Both groups showed robust attentional capture by the rewarded stimuli, measured by the latency to look away from a valuable, rewarded image. Importantly, there was no effect of the lesion on attentional capture. The same groups of animals were tested for attentional capture by innately valuable stimuli, including predators (e.g., snakes, crocodiles) and positive social cues (e.g., female perineum). Here, attentional capture was attenuated in the animals with amygdala lesions relative to controls. These data indicate that the amygdala is essential for attending to innately valuable but not learned reward-predictive stimuli.We have also studied the neural basis of reward processing in a social context. Previous research shows that animals choose to deliver rewards to their conspecifics under some conditions. This apparent prosocial preference suggests that the sight of another animal receiving reward is vicariously reinforcing. Here, we evaluated how pupil size, an autonomic correlate of arousal, changed when animals anticipated that juice would be delivered to themselves, another conspecific animal, or not at all. Two animals sat opposite each other while one, the actor, was visually cued to the upcoming juice delivery outcome and could choose to complete or abort the trial. Consistent with previous research, actors chose to complete most self-reward trials, a moderate number of other-reward trials, and the fewest neither-reward trials, suggesting that they did prefer juice delivery to the other animal over juice delivery to nobody. As expected, pupil size was widest in anticipation of the animals own reward. Paradoxically, pupil size was more constricted in anticipation of reward to the other animal than in anticipation of reward to nobody. Thus, trial completion rates suggest animals find reward delivery to another animal reinforcing, but pupil size suggests they find it aversive. Thus, there may be both positive and negative affect associated with vicarious reinforcement.Studies examining the effects of focal brain lesions provide critical insights on the relationships between brain structure and behavior. Current techniques allow researchers to damage cell bodies selectively, while sparing fibers of passage. A major challenge of the lesion method is documenting the degree to which the lesion is both complete and selective for the region of interest. Currently, lesion extent is manually drawn on a series of sections of a reference brain from visual inspection of a postoperative T1 MRI scan (in which damage appears as relative hyposignal), T2 MRI scan (in which damage appears as relative hypersignal), or histology slides. However, this approach is time-consuming and difficult to standardize. Recent advances in automated nonlinear registration algorithms and the advent of a standard brain template may improve the speed and standardization of lesion mapping. Here, we employ a semi-automated method to map cortical lesion boundaries (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex, prelimbic cortex, premotor cortex) from multiple subjects to a single standard template. This two-step process involves: 1) manually tracing the lesions in native space on the subjects postoperative MRI scan, and 2) warping the traced lesion mask and postoperative scan to template space using a nonlinear algorithm provided by a validated neuroimaging software package, ANTs. We further evaluate the extent to which the damage registered in the in vivo scans are representative of the actual surgical damage by comparing these digitized masks to traditional Nissl-stained histological material. This approach provides an improved method for lesion mapping that saves time, standardizes results, and provides multiple options for quantifying lesion extent and generating informative 2D and 3D visualizations.Selective, fiber-sparing excitotoxic lesions are a state-of-the-art tool for studying the causal contributions of different brain areas to behavior. We routinely use MRI to plan and to guide injections of excitotoxins into specific regions to produce selective cell loss (i.e., lesions). In addition, we routinely assess the extent of excitotoxic lesions in vivo, using MRI-based methods, within a few weeks of the operation. To determine whether in vivo T2-weighted MRI accurately estimates damage following selective excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala, we compared lesion volume estimates for the amygdala obtained from MRI and traditional histology. Across 19 hemispheres from 13 subjects, MRI assessment consistently overestimated amygdala damage compared to microscopic examination of Nissl-stained histological material. Two outliers suggested that near-complete MRI-estimated damage may predict actual damage of at least 45%, but more data  are necessary to evaluate this hypothesis. However, excitotoxins routinely produce extensive damage (median = 82%) that correlates with total injection volume, validating the general success of the technique. The field will benefit from more research into these assessment methods, and the accuracy of MRI assessment in different brain areas. For now, in vivo MRI assessment of lesions of the amygdala can be used to confirm successful injections, but estimates of lesion extent should be interpreted with caution.","Affect;Algorithms;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Anogenital region;Ants;Anxiety Disorders;Area;Arousal;Attention;Attenuated;Autistic Disorder;base;Behavior;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;cell injury;Cells;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Choice Behavior;Clinical Research;cognitive process;Computer software;cortex mapping;Crocodylus;Cues;Data;Decision Making;Deep Brain Stimulation;Discrimination;Disease;Electrophysiology (science);Emotional;Emotions;Excitatory Neurotoxins;Excitotoxic lesion;Eye;Face;Facial Expression;Female;Fiber;Foundations;frontal lobe;Functional disorder;gaze;Genetic;Goals;Health;histological stains;Histology;Image;Imagery;improved;in vivo;indexing;Injection of therapeutic agent;insight;interest;Intervention;Juice;Knowledge;Learning;Lesion;Limbic System;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Major Depressive Disorder;Manuals;Masks;Measures;Medial;Mental disorders;Methodology;Methods;Microscopic;Modeling;Molecular;Mood Disorders;MRI Scans;Nature;negative affect;neuroimaging;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;operation;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral cavity;Outcome;outcome prediction;Panic Attack;Patients;Performance;Phobias;Play;Postoperative Period;preference;Prefrontal Cortex;Probability;Process;Psychological reinforcement;Pupil;Quality of life;reduce symptoms;relating to nervous system;Research;Research Personnel;reward anticipation;reward processing;Rewards;Role;Scanning;Schizophrenia;Series;showing emotion;Slide;Snakes;social;Social Environment;Speed;Stains;Standardization;Stimulus;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;success;Techniques;Testing;Time;tool;Training;Translating;Update;Vision;Visual;Work;","NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF REWARD PROCESSING AND EMOTION",n/a,"NIMH","9568269","","",1ZIAMH002887-11,1,ZIA,MH,002887,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"1905955","MURRAY, ELISABETH A",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1218093,
"Clinical Research;HIV/AIDS;Health Services;Mental Health;Patient Safety;Women's Health","CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT SERVICES: A central mission of the OCD is to ensure that research participants receive the highest quality clinical care. The OCD is responsible for oversight of all clinical aspects of the NIMH Intramural Research Program (NIMH IRP). HUMAN SUBJECT PROTECTIONS:  The mission of the Human Subject Protections Unit (HSPU) is to ensure the protection of vulnerable subjects participating in research and to educate researchers and participants. This team works with investigators, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and the Clinical Center (CC) Bioethics Department to identify and ameliorate risks for vulnerable subjects. Responsibilities include: 1) Consent and Assent Monitoring which assesses the quality of the informed consent process and ensures that all of the required elements of the protocol are discussed with participants.  Assent monitoring ensures the quality of the assent discussion and verifies the agreement of the subject to participate in research. 2) Subject Monitoring of all NIMH inpatients verifies ongoing informed consent over the course of their participation to assess current wishes, understanding, and concerns regarding continued participation in research. 3) Capacity Assessment is a clinical assessment of an adult participant's ability to provide informed consent for a specific protocol. For select high-risk studies, a capacity assessment must be completed prior to study participation. 4) Ability to Appoint an NIH Advanced Directive/Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) Assessment determines a participant's ability to choose another person to be his/her decision-maker for research participation. 5) Appropriateness of the Surrogate Assessment determines the appointed surrogate decision-maker's ability to represent a participant's wishes and provide consent. 6) Training and Education: The HSPU developed and conducts the Elements of a Successful Consent, a required training for investigators obtaining informed consent. To date, over 1200 NIH staff have completed this training. This training is also available as a computer-based training program. The HSPU provides customized presentations and trainings to meet the specific human subject protection needs of individual research teams at NIH. In response to inquiries from other institutions, the HSPU is developing a toolkit to assist research organizations to assess, develop and implement appropriate levels of human subjects protections at their own facilities. The MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS AND RECRUITMENT UNIT (MCRU) facilitates comprehensive and diverse NIMH patient recruitment through design and materials development, targeted marketing and advertising planning, and community outreach. In FY17, our Community Outreach Program reached over 12,000 individuals through over 200 meetings with providers, consumers, community members, 27 scientific seminars, and electronic mailings. PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY (PSQ): In 2016, the OCD established the Office of Patient Safety and Quality. The Clinical Director, along with other OCD staff, oversees NIMH quality improvement initiatives and meets with branch/section/lab chiefs and managers to assist with designing patient safety and quality improvement initiatives, with a dual focus of improving and ensuring quality clinical care, and sharing their experiences with the larger NIMH intramural clinical care group during monthly PSQ meetings. The OCD also tracks and trends Clinical Center occurrences and ensures follow-up. The OCD sends representatives to Clinical Center safety and quality initiatives, including daily patient safety huddles, the hospital-wide Clinical Care and Quality meeting, and the Patient Safety Clinical Practice and Quality Committee. NIMH monthly safety meetings for basic science labs are also attended by an OCD representative. CLINICAL OVERSIGHT: The OCD team meets regularly with medical and nursing leadership to review census, discuss clinical concerns and plan for future initiatives. The monthly PSQ meeting is also a forum for communication of hospital-related policies and regulations and includes quality improvement projects from each branch/section. The OCD team has coordinated the hospital-wide implementation of suicide risk screening at the Clinical Center (CC) in response to a 2016 Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert calling for suicide risk screening of all medical patients in the hospital setting (see ZIA MH002922-09). The OCD is responsible for reviewing the qualifications of all clinical personnel and is involved in maintaining the clinical competence of all NIMH health care professionals. The OCD serves as the link between the CC hospital and the Institute. The OCD is responsible for the implementation of CC policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The OCD participates in annual CC budget planning meetings with the CC and IC Directors and coordinates hospital initiatives such as preparation for Joint Commission accreditation visits, annual flu shot compliance, etc. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT: In 2016 the OCD established an Office for Regulatory Oversight (ORO) focused on compliance with regulatory requirements and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This office coordinates the scientific review of new and ongoing protocols and provides protocol navigation services to NIMH IRP investigators. The navigation team provides direct support to investigators for all aspects of IRB submissions and tracking of investigator trainings. The OCD has implemented genetic data sharing and data sharing plans for intramural studies in accordance with NIH policy. The OCD coordinates a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to oversee DIRP protocols. Two clinical monitors develop and implement individualized monitoring plans for all active NIMH IRP protocols. This team also provides training and develops corrective action plans as needed. TRAINING AND EDUCATION: The NIMH OCD works in partnership with the NIMH Office of Fellowship Training (OFT) and the Office of Clinical Research and Training in Medical Education (OCRTME) to oversee and participate in several programs that train and educate new physicians and medical students. In addition, the NIMH OCD contributes to initiatives that identify and promote academic research careers among promising early career psychiatrists. See OCD Training report ZIEMH002939-05 for additional details. CONSULTATION LIAISON: The NIMH Psychiatry Consultation Liaison Service (PCLS) and Neuropsychology Consultation Service are teams that provide multidisciplinary clinical services to patients enrolled in clinical protocols at the NIH CC. Two additional clinical services were added in 2017, the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service (see Dr. Thurm's report ZIC-MH002961-01) and the Sleep and Neurodevelopment Service (see Dr. Buckley's report ZIC-MH002962-01).

"Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Emergency Care;HIV/AIDS;Health Services;Infectious Diseases;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Prevention;Rare Diseases;Suicide;Suicide Prevention;Women's Health","The three areas of OCD research are:Suicide Risk in the Medical SettingSuicide is an international public health threat. In the U.S., it is the 2nd leading cause of death for youth and the 10th leading cause of death for adults. The Director of NIMH, Dr. Joshua Gordon has made suicide prevention research an NIMH priority. In addition, the accreditation board for hospitals, The Joint Commission (JC), has issued a Sentinel Event Alert stating that all medical patients should be screened for suicide risk in the hospital setting. As suicide risk screening becomes a national priority for medical settings, non-mental health clinicians require valid, psychometrically-sound screening instruments for assessing suicide risk. However, there are very few suicide risk screening instruments that have been validated empirically with medically ill patients in hospital settings. Given that we have several NIMH IRB approved protocols to study suicide risk screening in the medical setting, this became a tremendous opportunity for our research team to meet Dr. Gordon's request for turning research into practice, and we have several implementation projects for suicide risk screening underway. Recognizing this gap early and capitalizing on clinical and research expertise within our group, we began developing a risk of suicide screen for pediatric patients in the emergency room in 2008 which resulted in a validated tool, the ASQ (Ask Suicide Screening Questions). The ASQ has been translated into 8 languages now, including Spanish, French, Dutch, Arabic, Portuguese, Hebrew, Korean and Chinese and is currently being implemented in emergency departments, inpatient medical units and outpatient primary care clinics in the U.S. and abroad. The tool is available on the NIMH website at http://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/ask-suicide-screening-questions-asq.shtml for public use. Since the development of the ASQ, the focus of our ongoing suicide risk screening studies has been to develop and validate brief screening instruments that can be administered by non-mental health clinicians in other medical settings and with specific patient populations. We currently have 5 IRB-approved protocols addressing suicide screening in different medical settings (NCT00623493, NCT01517126, NCT02140177, NCT02050867, NCT02830334). We are addressing areas of need, including pediatric and adult emergency department patients, and pediatric and adult medical inpatients, and developing a screening tools for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disabilities. In addition, our research team is working closely with NIH CC leadership to meet the JC recommendations and have been actively engaged in implementing suicide screening in adult medical inpatients admitted to the NIH CC with a plan to roll out implementation for pediatric medical inpatients in the coming year. Turning research into practice, we are utilizing our research to inform implementation of suicide risk screening at the NIH CC and hospitals nationwide. Mental Health Aspects of Coping with Chronic Medical IllnessBorn out of our clinical work on the PCLS and neuropsychology assessment service for the past decade, a natural research focus has emerged from our collaborative work with other Institutes at NIH. For example, working with the Pediatric Oncology Branch we began to study distress and its correlates in medically ill children, particularly those with life-limiting illnesses, through 3 protocols over the past 6 years (NCT00824278, NCT00969579, NCT02423031). The collaboration has been highly productive leading to the development of the first advance care planning guide for adolescents and young adults with life-limiting illnesses, Voicing My CHOiCES. This planning guide is available at www.agingwithdignity.org. In addition, our work in quantifying distress will be implemented in a pilot assessment of patients undergoing radiation treatment at the Clinical Center beginning late summer 2017. Development and validation of Checking In, a brief electronic interactive screening measure of distress designed to identify emotional, physical, social, practical and spiritual concerns of pediatric patients, is ongoing. An accompanying provider summary sheet that delineates patient report of distress will allow providers to triage services to patients and their families, thereby enhancing patient quality of life throughout the treatment trajectory.Another study (NCT01778478) focuses on how to screen and diagnose psychiatric disorders in young adults (ages 18-25) with and without cancer. The study examines the feasibility of using the structured psychiatric diagnostic interview, Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), in this age group and evaluates whether the parent interview affects diagnostic findings. In addition, the study assesses psychosocial developmental milestone acquisition among young adult cancer patients compared to their healthy peers. Neuropsychiatric Aspects of Immune and Infectious Disorders (including HIV/AIDS), Genetic, and other DisordersThe OCD Neuropsychology Unit is involved in a broad range of research protocols that are studying cognitive and emotional functioning in various diagnostic groups. These research protocols include genetic disorders (such as Mobius syndrome, methylmalonic academia, McCune-Albright syndrome, Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Sub-cortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)), infectious and immune diseases (HIV, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Ebola, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis), brain tumor (re-irradiation effects), and chronic fatigue syndrome.A large focus of these neuropsychiatric studies is HIV/AIDS. HIV-related research activities in the OCD fall into two categories: 1) NIH Intramural NeuroHIV Program, and 2) Collaborations with multi-site research networks, including an NIH DoD HIV/AIDS associated neurocognitive disorder protocol.  The NIMH OCD, NINDS and NIAID have developed 2 intramural protocols (NCT01875588; NCT01692236) investigating HIV-related neurocognitive disorders, which are a clinical challenge and threat to the long-term health of people living with HIV/AIDS. In addition, we have worked to assess the mental health needs of HIV patients and build an interdisciplinary approach to HIV and mental health in DC, leading to funded projects being initiated at other DC institutions.","Academia;Accident and Emergency department;Accreditation;Address;Adolescent and Young Adult;Adult;Advance Care Planning;Affect;Age;age group;AIDS/HIV problem;Area;autism spectrum disorder;Behavioral;Brain Neoplasms;brief screening;CADASIL;Cancer Patient;Categories;Cause of Death;Child;Childhood;Chinese People;Chronic;Chronic Fatigue Syndrome;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cognitive;Collaborations;Communicable Diseases;Comorbidity;Consult;Consultations;coping;Depressed mood;design;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Distress;Ebola virus;Emergency Department patient;Emotional;Encephalitis;Event;Extramural Activities;falls;Family;Funding;Genetic;Health;Health Services Research;Hereditary Disease;HIV;Hospitals;Immune System Diseases;Individual;Inpatients;Institutes;Institution;instrument;Intellectual functioning disability;interdisciplinary approach;International;Interview;Intramural Research Program;irradiation;Joints;Koreans;Language;Leadership;Life;Longevity;Malignant Neoplasms;McCune-Albright Syndrome;Measures;Medical;Medical center;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Mission;Mobius Syndrome;Mood Disorders;multidisciplinary;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;neurocognitive disorder;neuropsychiatry;Neuropsychology;news;Nurses;Outpatients;Parents;patient population;Patients;Pediatric Oncology;pediatric patients;peer;Phenotype;physical conditioning;Portuguese;Prevention Research;Primary Health Care;programs;Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy;Protocols documentation;Provider;Psychiatric Diagnosis;Psychiatrist;Psychiatry;Psychologist;Psychometrics;psychosocial;Public Health;Quality of life;Radiation therapy;Rare Diseases;Recommendation;Reporting;Research;Research Activity;Research Personnel;research to practice;Research Training;Resources;Schedule;Schizophrenia;Science;screening;Sentinel;Services;Signs and Symptoms;Site;social;Social Workers;sound;Structure;suicidal risk;Suicide;Suicide prevention;Time;tool;Translating;Triage;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Voice;web site;Work;young adult;Youth;","PSYCHIATRY CONSULTATION LIAISON SERVICE RESEARCH",n/a,"NIMH","9569197","","",1ZIAMH002922-09,1,ZIA,MH,002922,09,,Unavailable,"","","",,"10422620","PAO, MARYLAND ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,661570,
"HIV/AIDS;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences","Clinical Fellowship Programs: During FY17, there were seven NIMH IRP residents/fellows. The academic year generally starts in July so this number could include new, current and departing trainees in our programs. Of the seven trainees, three were in our PGY-4 ACGME accredited psychiatry residency program at some point in the year. We added one new trainee in FY17, who is a PGY4 resident. No clinical fellows departed this year.PGY4 Psychiatry Residency: The NIMH residency program is a unique one-year program that provides nearly full-time research training while at the same time fulfilling the ACGME requirements of the fourth year of residency. Psychiatry residents who transfer to the program have completed all required clinical rotations prior to coming to NIMH. Administrative duties: The Program Director for the PGY4 residency and clinical fellowship program is the Chair of the NIH Graduate Medical Education Committee (GMEC). The NIMH OCD appoints a clinical fellow to the Clinical Fellows Committee of the NIH Clinical Center and has a PGY4 representative as well. Other affiliated training programsNIH Clinical Center Hospice and Palliative Medicine fellowship program: this accredited program is sponsored by the NIMH ACGME-approved PGY4 psychiatry residency. The two programs work together to support the clinical training of fellows by joint conferences and clinical interactions.Psychosomatic Medicine (PM) fellowship program: this one year ACGME-accredited subspecialty fellowship is conducted in partnership with Georgetown University Medical Center and Washington Hospital Center and selects two fellows per year. The PM fellows rotate on the NIMH Psychiatric Consultation Liaison Service at the NIH Clinical Center, each for six months.Research electives for psychiatry residents and child psychiatry fellows: There were five residents/fellows from local training programs who rotated to NIMH for research electives. Two child fellows from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, a child fellow from Georgetown University, and two general psychiatry residents from Georgetown participated in electives this year. Medical Student Programs:The Clinical Electives Program (CEP) at the NIH Clinical Center provides fourth year medical students with direct exposure to the conduct of clinical research after completion of their core medical school clinical rotations. The OCD helps coordinate medical student rotations in Adult Psychopharmacology, and Psychosomatic Medicine; other elective options available on request.Medical Research Scholars Program (MRSP) at the NIH Clinical Center is a selective year-long elective research year for medical students who live and work on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Deputy Clinical Director and NIMH IRP faculty have served as mentors or been on the MRSP Board of Advisors. Advisors interview and select students for the program, and help them identify an appropriate research mentor. Clinical Neuroscience Initiatives:The OCD leads two NIMH national initiatives (ORAP and Brain Camp) that promote psychiatrists-in-training to choose and succeed in clinical neuroscience research as well as conferences that promote neuroscience education for psychiatrists.The NIMH Outstanding Resident Award Program (ORAP) was started in 1988 and is a highly coveted and competitive annual award for promising young psychiatrists-in-training. The ORAP awardees are psychiatry residents with outstanding academic potential who are selected from among the top residencies in the U.S. and who have been nominated by their training directors. This award is given to a small number of residents each year for past achievements, current efforts, and future contributions to the field of psychiatry. In fall 2016, 12 recipients traveled to Bethesda for a two-day program that featured presentations by NIMH investigators, extramural program staff and a tour of NIMH facilities. In June 2017, a new group of ORAP residents was selected with 12 awardees and 6 honorable mentions.NIMH Brain Camp is an annual scientific retreat for psychiatry residents with a strong background and interest in research careers. The program, started in 2009, involves lectures and discussions between residents, invited distinguished faculty and NIMH leadership, on a variety of cutting edge neuroscience topics relevant to psychiatry. Most of the residents who attend Brain Camp are awardees of the previous year's ORAP. The OCD participates at national meetings on the topic of education in neuroscience and research training. The Program Director of the PGY4 residency and clinical fellowship program was a faculty member for the BRAIN pre-conference at the March 2017 American Association of Directors of Psychiatry Residency Programs (AADPRT) annual meeting during which newly developed NIMH-funded neuroscience curriculum modules were taught and disseminated. Trans-NIH InitiativesThe NIMH Office of the Clinical Director spearheaded a collaborative project with internal NIH IRP stakeholders to develop and disseminate materials for Training Directors, supervisor and trainees about how best to serve and manage the distressed trainee in the workplace. The 5-Item Toolkit was developed to include information about how, where, and under what circumstances to access resources on campus to proactively manage professional challenges, work-life balance, cultural adaptation, mental health issues, conflict resolution, crisis intervention and emergency response.","Academic Medical Centers;Accreditation;Achievement;Adult;American;Award;Behavioral;Brain;Brain imaging;career;career life balance;Child;Child Psychiatry;Clinical;Clinical Research;conflict resolution;Consultations;Crisis Intervention;Development Plans;Distress;Doctor of Philosophy;Education;Educational Curriculum;Emergency response;Endocrinology;experience;Exposure to;Extramural Activities;Faculty;falls;Fellowship;Fellowship Program;Funding;Future;Goals;graduate medical education;hands on research;hospice environment;Hospitals;Individual;interest;Interview;Intramural Research Program;Joints;Leadership;lectures;Major Mental Illness;Maryland;Medical center;Medical Education;Medical Research;medical schools;medical specialties;Medical Students;meetings;member;Mental Health;Mentors;Mentorship;Military Personnel;Molecular;National Institute of Mental Health;NCI Scholars Program;Neurobiology;neurodevelopment;neurogenetics;Neurosciences;Neurosciences Research;novel therapeutics;Palliative Medicine;Physicians;Positioning Attribute;Post Graduate Year;programs;Psychiatrist;Psychiatry;Psychopharmacology;Psychosomatic Medicine;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Research Training;Residencies;Resources;Retreatment;Rotation;Services;severe mental illness;skills;Students;symposium;Time;Training;Training Programs;Training Support;Travel;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Washington;Work;Workplace;Writing;","OFFICE OF THE CLINICAL DIRECTOR-PSYCHIATRY CLINICAL RESEARCH TRAINING",n/a,"NIMH","9569208","","",1ZIEMH002939-05,1,ZIE,MH,002939,05,,Unavailable,"","","",,"10422620","PAO, MARYLAND ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2143375,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Depression;Mental Health;Neurosciences","This fiscal year we made substantial progress in characterizing the various neuronal populations of the PVT. For this purpose, we combined anatomical tracings, mouse genetics and viral vector methodologies, and identified three potential subclasses of PVT neurons. In particular, a subpopulation of PVT neurons that expresses dopamine D2 receptors, displays rapid increases in excitability following stress. Importantly, we have now unraveled a cellular and molecular mechanism underlying this stress-mediated increase in excitability.  Furthermore, evidence collected by our group indicates that genetic disruption of this mechanism prevents the formation of a stress memory in the PVT. In summary, our observations highlight the presence of an unexpected circuit mechanism underlying the formation of stress memories.  Scientific progress made during FY2017 at the Unit on the Neurobiology of Affective Memory, was marked by the incorporation of new technologies, such as fiber photometry. Using this technique in combination with genetically-encoded calcium and chloride sensors we were able to include in vivo assessment of stress circuits to our repertory of technical approaches. This new incorporation, together with other technological additions has significantly accelerated scientific progress in our laboratory.","Address;Affective;anatomical tracing;Animal Behavior;Anxiety Disorders;Behavior;behavioral response;Brain;Calcium Chloride;Disease remission;Dopamine D2 Receptor;effective therapy;Electrophysiology (science);Fiber;Genetic;Genetic Vectors;Image;Impairment;in vivo;interdisciplinary approach;Laboratories;Lead;Major Depressive Disorder;Mediating;Memory;Methodology;Mission;Molecular;Mood Disorders;Mus;negative emotional state;Neurobiology;Neurons;new technology;optogenetics;Pathologic;Photometry;Population;Predisposition;prevent;Process;psychological stressor;Quality of life;sensor;Societies;Stress;Structure;Structure of paraventricular nucleus of thalamus;Techniques;Testing;treatment strategy;Viral Vector;","DISSECTING THE STRESS CIRCUITS OF THE PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS OF THE THALAMUS",n/a,"NIMH","9568283","","",1ZIAMH002950-02,1,ZIA,MH,002950,02,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14761202","PENZO, MARIO ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1525037,

Genetic manipulation has taken advantage of the ability to grow totipotent cells (embryonic stem cells, ESC) in a dish. Other species, including primates, have been refractory to the same technique that works so well for mice. The result has been an ever-expanding collection of transgenic mouse lines that scientists use to test the role of virtually every one of the roughly 20,000 genes that make up a mouse genome.  Now, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to target genes more efficiently and as specifically as in mouse ESC, but is applicable to other species. The core has focused on using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate conditional knock out genes in mice, rats and primates. In these animals, recombination signals are inserted to flank critical regions of a gene. Only when a recombinase is expressed in the cell is the gene function disrupted. Subtle changes in the gene can also be made, but making a conditional modification replaces large segments of a gene.The core has over the last year benefited from a collaboration with Nick Ryba in the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to improve the efficiency of modifying genes by replacing large segments. We have optimized concentration of the injected material, the use of reagents to optimize homologous recombination of donor sequences, the site of injection in embryos, and the construction of nucleic acid targeting vectors. These techniques are now being applied to make mouse and rat transgenics, with the ultimate aim of making the technique efficient enough to use in species with smaller numbers of offspring, and longer gestation and maturation times, such as marmosets.b) Transgenic marmosets: In collaboration with Erika Sasaki at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals in Kawasaki, Japan the core has produced a line of transgenic marmosets that expresses a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) which will allow the visualization of neuronal activity in vivo. To expand a line of animals that express this gene, we have developed an artificial insemination procedure that has resulted in multiple pregnancies in the NIMH colony and in the Xiaoqin Wang's colony at Johns Hopkins University. These animals are being used for experiments on the activity in the sensory cortex.c) Transgenic rat lines: Over 50 laboratories from around the world have requested transgenic rat lines that were produced by the transgenic core in collaboration with labs in NIDA. These lines are being maintained and distributed by  the RRRC (Rat Resource and Research Center). More than ten of these lines that express CRE recombinase in specific neuronal subtypes are continuing to be characterized for their patterns of expression. An inbred line of rats that expresses the orange fluorescent protein (OFP) is being used by Alan Korestsky's group (NINDS) to study the potential of transplanted neural stem cells.d) Support techniques: several techniques are under development to increase the capacity of the core's support functions. Freezing mouse sperm and improving IVF by using newer methods is a major effort. Freezing rat sperm and achieving IVF in rats at an acceptable level is a challenging task in all laboratories. A method of introducing adeno-associated virus (AAV) to the brain through the peripheral circulation is also underway. This method would allow more widespread delivery of a transgene and eliminate the need for intracranial delivery by surgical intervention.","Affect;Age;Animal Experimentation;Animals;Archives;Artificial Insemination;autism spectrum disorder;Behavior;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological Models;Blood Circulation;Brain;calcium indicator;Callithrix;Cells;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Collaborations;Collection;Complex;Core Facility;CRISPR/Cas technology;Dependovirus;design;Development;Disease;DNA;Electrophysiology (science);Embryo;Embryonic Development;embryonic stem cell;Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase;experience;experimental study;Freezing;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;gene function;Gene Targeting;Genes;genetic approach;Genetic Engineering;genetic manipulation;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Research;genetic risk factor;Germ Cells;Health Status;homologous recombination;Human;Human Genome;Imagery;improved;in vivo;Inbreeding;Individual;Injectable;Injection of therapeutic agent;Institutes;Japan;Knock-out;Laboratories;Lead;Link;Maps;Mediating;Mental disorders;Methods;Modification;mouse genome;Multiple Pregnancy;Mus;National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research;National Institute of Drug Abuse;National Institute of Mental Health;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;nerve stem cell;Nervous System Physiology;Nervous system structure;Neurons;neuropsychiatric disorder;Neurosciences;Neurosciences Research;new technology;nuclease;Nucleic Acids;offspring;Oocytes;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oranges;pathogen;Patients;Pattern;Penetrance;Peripheral;Pregnancy;Primates;Procedures;Process;Production;Proteins;Rattus;Reagent;recombinase;Refractory;relating to nervous system;Research;Research Support;Resources;Rodent;Role;Schizophrenia;Scientist;sensory cortex;Signal Transduction;Site;sperm cell;Symptoms;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;Totipotent cell;Transgenes;Transgenic Animals;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Transplantation;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;vector;virtual;Work;","TRANSGENIC RESOURCES FOR NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH",n/a,"NIMH","9568291","","",1ZICMH002901-11,1,ZIC,MH,002901,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416754","PICKEL, JAMES ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,3319825,
"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Mental Health;Neurosciences","The Molecular Imaging Branch (MIB) aims to exploit positron emission tomography (PET) as a radiotracer imaging technique for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, depression, addiction, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Fundamental to this mission is the development of novel radioactive probes (radiotracers) that can be used with PET to measure changes in low level proteins in the brains of living human subjects where these proteins are suspected to have critical involvement in the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders.  Such proteins include some neuroreceptors, transporters, enzymes, and plaques.  PET is uniquely powerful and sensitive when coupled with the use of biochemically-specific PET radiotracers. The chemical development of new radiotracers is the key to exploiting the full potential of PET in neuropsychiatric research.  However, a successful PET radiotracer must satisfy a wide range of difficult-to-satisfy chemical, biochemical and pharmacological criteria.  Consequently, PET radiotracer development is highly challenging.  In fact, our research has some parallels with drug discovery in that it entails high effort and heavy risk, but can reap rich biomedical rewards.  Even now, the number of potentially interesting imaging targets (brain proteins) far exceeds the range of currently available and useful radiotracers.Within MIB, the PET Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Section (PRSS) places a concerted effort on all chemical and radiochemical aspects of PET radiotracer discovery. Our laboratories are equipped for medicinal chemistry and automated radiochemistry with positron-emitting carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20 min) and fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 110 min). These two very short-lived radioisotopes are available to us daily from the adjacent cyclotrons of the NIH Clinical Center (Chief: Dr. P. Herscovitch). Our section interacts seamlessly with the Section on PET Neuroimaging Sciences in our branch (Chief: Dr. R.B. Innis) for early evaluation of potential radiotracers in biological models and in animals. Subsequent PET research in human subjects is also performed in collaboration with the Imaging Section under Food and Drug Administration oversight through 'exploratory' or 'full' Investigational New Drug applications. In the period covered by this report, we worked on developing PET radiotracers for several targets. These include TSPO; many receptors (glutamate(NMDA),serotonin subtype 1B (5-HT1B), histamine subtype-3 (H3)); enzymes (COX-1, COX-2, PDE1 and PDE4 subtypes, cPLA2, OGA); and tau fibril deposits.   One radiotracer that we earlier developed for TSPO imaging (C-11PBR28) has been applied by many imaging centers to investigate brain inflammatory conditions in response to various neurological insults (e.g., stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration). An unexpected finding is that healthy human subjects, because of a genetic difference, carry either one or both of two distinct forms of TSPO and that these interact differently with C-11PBR28, complicating the analysis of PET studies.  Consequently, we sought to develop genetically-insensitive TSPO radiotracers. We explored new chemotypes with potential to provide superior PET radiotracers for TSPO.  One of our new radiotracers, C-11ER176, appeared promising for avoiding genotype sensitivity from study in animals and in human tissue in vitro. Although C-11ER176 does not show the expected genotype insensitivity in living humans, it does turn out to be perhaps the highest performing TSPO radiotracer yet known. We and other imaging centers now plan to use this radiotracer for clinical studies in human subjects.  In addition, we are developing radiotracers for other targets relevant to the study of neuroinflammation, such as the cyclooxygenase (COX) subtype 1 and subtype 2 enzymes. Very promising radiotracers have been identified, and two of these are to be advanced for evaluation in human subjects. These radiotracers may provide more biochemical and cellular specificity for investigation of neuroinflammation. In this regard, we have started to explore the development of radiotracers for other enzymes implicated in neuroinflammation, such as cPLA2.mGlu5 receptor radiotracers have interest for the study of addiction, as well as other disorders, notably Fragile X syndrome associated with autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia. We reported our comparison of two new high-performing mGlu5 radiotracers (C-11SP203 and C-11FPEB) in human subjects and our recently developed radiotracer (F-18FIMX) for a very related receptor target, namely mGlu1.  Studies in human show this radiotracer performs exceptionally well. NMDA is another protein acted upon by the important neurotransmitter, glutamate, for which we continue developing radiotracers. In collaboration with Prof. Diaz-Arrastia and colleagues (Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences), we have been developing radiotracers for imaging the accumulation of brain neurofibrillary tangles (tau protein), which may underlie the development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD and traumatic brain injury.  We have identified three distinct radiotracer binding sites on tau fibrils and have discovered several compounds that might serve as leads to PET radiotracers for tau imaging.  Ligand-based virtual screening has also been explored as a tool for PET radiotracer discovery.   PET radiotracers can provide important quantitative information on experimental therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders, such as ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier and to engage with a target protein. In collaborations with academia and Pharma, we are developing several radiotracers for this purpose.  Some of these radiotracers are targeted at proteins that have not previously been imaged in living human brain, and that may have eventual clinical research utility. These proteins include subtypes of phosphodiesterase (especially with regard to depression), and the enzyme OGA (especially with regard to dementia). We are currently evaluating a very promising radiotracer for OGA in human subjects. The development of radiotracers for phosphodiesterase subtypes shows early promise. We are advancing our methodology for improved radiotracer development.  New labeling agents have been developed for C-11 chemistry, notably C-11fluoroform which opens up wide chemical space for potential radiotracer development. We have also succeeded in developing a method for F-18fluoroform synthesis at a higher molar activity than hitherto possible, again expanding possibilities for new radiotracer development. New radiolabeling chemistries have been developed to utilize C-11fluoroform or F-18fluoroforms.  Sensitive mass spectrometry has been developed to measure radiotracer concentration in blood following intravenous administration, as is required to analyze PET experiments.  LC-MS/MS has the potential to avoid the demanding logistics associated with measuring fast-decaying radioactivity. Productive collaborations continue with external academic chemistry and medicinal chemistry laboratories, nationally and internationally, and with pharmaceutical companies. Productive collaborations also exist with other centers working with PET and its associated radiochemistry and radiotracer development.  The laboratory is active in training new scientists for this field at graduate and postdoctoral level.We produce some useful radiotracers that have been developed elsewhere for PET investigations in animal or human subjects e.g., C-11rolipram (for PDE4 enzyme imaging), and C-11clozapine for investigation of DREAAD technology.  Each PET experiment with any radiotracer requires a radiosynthesis of the radiotracer on the same day, and hence radiotracer production is a regular activity.","Academia;addiction;Affect;Alzheimer's Disease;Animals;Anxiety;autism spectrum disorder;Autistic Disorder;base;Behavior;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biochemical Process;Biological Models;Biology;biomathematics;Blood;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Carbon;Chemicals;Chemistry;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Coupled;cyclooxygenase 1;cyclooxygenase 2;Cyclotrons;Dementia;Deposition;design;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug Addiction;drug discovery;Enzymes;Epilepsy;Evaluation;experimental study;Fluorine;Foundations;Fragile X Syndrome;Functional disorder;Genetic;Genotype;Glutamates;GRM1 gene;GRM5 gene;Health Sciences;Histamine;Human;human subject;human tissue;Image;Imaging Techniques;improved;In Vitro;Inflammatory;insight;interest;International;intravenous administration;Investigation;Investigational New Drug Application;Investigational Therapies;Investigative Techniques;Label;Laboratories;Ligands;Logistics;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Medicine;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Metabolism;Methodology;Methods;Mission;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;molecular imaging;molecular site;N-Methylaspartate;National Institute of Mental Health;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurofibrillary Tangles;neuroimaging;neuroinflammation;Neurologic;neuropsychiatric disorder;neuropsychiatry;neurotransmission;Neurotransmitter Receptor;Neurotransmitters;novel;Organic Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacology;phosphodiesterase IV;phosphoric diester hydrolase;Physics;Positron;Positron-Emission Tomography;Production;programs;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;Proteins;Psychiatry;Radio;Radioactive;Radioactivity;radiochemical;Radiochemistry;Radioisotopes;Radiolabeled;Radiopharmaceuticals;radiotracer;receptor;Reporting;Research;response;Rewards;Risk;Schizophrenia;Science;Scientist;screening;Sensory Receptors;Serotonin;Specificity;Stroke;targeted imaging;tau Proteins;Techniques;Technology;tool;Training;Traumatic Brain Injury;United States Food and Drug Administration;United States National Institutes of Health;University Health Services;virtual;Work;","PET RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES",n/a,"NIMH","9569192","","",1ZIAMH002793-16,1,ZIA,MH,002793,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"7348327","PIKE, VICTOR W",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,4051138,
"Anxiety Disorders;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities;Depression;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Mind and Body;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","This work is conducted under protocol 01-M-0192, NCT00018057.We are using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neurocognitive correlates of pediatric anxiety disorders. Through ongoing collaborative studies, we also have increasingly compared findings in these syndromes with findings in adult anxiety disorders as well as findings in other pediatric mental disorders. This involves a particularly deep interest in the relationships between pediatric anxiety and mood disorders. Through collaborative work, this allows us to examine the similarities and differences between pediatric and adult mood and anxiety disorders. From this vantage point, studies conducted at the NIH as part of this protocol focus most narrowly and deeply on pediatric anxiety disorders. On the other hand, studies conducted with collaborators focus most deeply on adult anxiety disorders and mood or other psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Finally, as the neural correlates of anxiety have been defined increasingly precisely through work in this protocol, we also focus on the manner in which effective treatment changes these neural correlates so that research on novel therapeutics might target such neural correlates. The work performed under this protocol and with the many associated collaborators holds the potential to dramatically impact public health, for various reasons. Mood and anxiety disorder dramatically alter the well-being of children and adolescents. Nevertheless, relatively little work has been conducted on the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions, using methods that allow direct extensions to work in basic neuroscience. fMRI research is vital for work in this area. Such research assesses brain function in children using methods that are directly comparable to the techniques used to study brain function in animal models. Work in this protocol holds the hope of generating insights on pathophysiology in a way that will lead to novel treatment discovery. This hope has increased in recent years for various reasons.  For example, work in this protocol and related studies has discovered replicable perturbations that might be targeted by novel treatments, identified through the confluence of findings in animal models and children.  In the current protocol, such work has focused on extinction, as it relates to cognitive behavioral therapy, and attention bias, as it relates to both cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive training. As such, this protocol defines a promising pathway for generating treatments that may alter clinical practice. In the past year, we have published a paper that demonstrates such promise, by targeting aspects of attention, extending research completed in prior years; two randomized controlled trials were published in this area through work with collaborators; moreover, a third randomized controlled trial was conducted on site at NIH and also has been reported in the past year.  Finally, this most recent study, unlike all prior studies in this area among youth, includes data from brain imaging, which directly connects a measure of brain function to a measure of treatment response, on very important potential breakthrough that is directly relevant to patient care. As such, this protocol demonstrates the potential importance of embedding a clinical trial within a brain imaging study. In future years, we will attempt to build on these recent findings through another randomized controlled trial that was initiated in the past year.   The central focus of the protocol is on individual differences in neural circuitry function, as they relate to individual differences in behavior and clinical response to treatment. Replicated findings from this project clearly implicate many such deficits in anxiety, moving research on developmental psychopathology into the domain of neuroscience. This shows that individual differences in behavior firmly relate to individual differences in brain function. In the past five years, our focus has been on extending attention-based and fear-conditioning work, in ways that most directly inform therapeutics. As noted above, this has led us to implement novel therapies. We have also devoted considerable time in the protocol to questions on disorder specificity, with a particular focus on comparing mood and anxiety-related problems in the past two years.  Prior neuropsychological studies in children as well as in adults note that mood and anxiety disorders are associated with deficits in attention modulation and emotional memory. We have found consistent evidence of such deficits in the current protocol. Moreover, prior imaging studies in healthy adults show that tasks requiring attention modulation or emotional memory engage cortico-limbic brain regions previously implicated in adult mood and anxiety disorders. These regions include the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus. Once again, we also find such evidence in the current set of projects, with multiple, replicated reports of cortico-limbic dysfunction in both pediatric and adult anxiety disorders. This shows that fMRI attention modulation and emotional memory paradigms differentially engage cortico-limbic brain regions in psychiatrically healthy and anxious, impaired subjects. These studies are ongoing in more than 500 subjects. For these subjects, each received neurocognitive examinations, and a subset received fMRI examinations. Each also received standardized assessments of response to treatment. As part of our studies in healthy subjects, we also successfully developed each of the fMRI protocols that will be used in the current project. As noted above, many of our initial hypotheses have been confirmed, and our studies are now moving forward to examine issues of specificity and to consider how our findings might be used to inform advances in treatment. This focus has led to the publication of three notable brain-imaging papers in the past year that compares and contrasts findings in anxiety and mood-related psychopathology among youth.    During the coming year, we will devote most of our time to build on these two new areas.  This includes continuing our recently initiated studies of novel treatments and implementing additional studies of disorder specificity.","Adolescent;Adult;Amygdaloid structure;Animal Model;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;anxious;Area;Attention;attentional bias;attentional modulation;base;Behavior;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Child;Childhood;childhood anxiety;cingulate gyrus;Clinical;clinical practice;Clinical Trials;Cognitive Therapy;cognitive training;conditioned fear;Data;Development;Disease;effective therapy;Emotional;Exhibits;Extinction (Psychology);Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Goals;Hyperactive behavior;imaging study;Impairment;Individual Differences;insight;interest;Major Depressive Disorder;Measures;Memory;Mental disorders;Methods;Mood Disorders;Moods;neural circuit;neural correlate;Neurocognitive;Neuropsychology;Neurosciences;novel;novel therapeutics;Paper;Parahippocampal Gyrus;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patients;Prefrontal Cortex;Protocols documentation;Psychopathology;Public Health;Publications;Publishing;Randomized Controlled Trials;Reporting;Research;Site;Specificity;Standardization;Stimulus;Syndrome;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Treatment outcome;treatment response;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;Youth;","FMRI STUDIES OF PEDIATRIC MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9568252","","",1ZIAMH002781-16,1,ZIA,MH,002781,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416709","PINE, DANIEL ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1911048,
"Anxiety Disorders;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Depression;Major Depressive Disorder;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Serious Mental Illness","This work is conducted under protocol 03-M-0186, NCT00060775.In this project, our group is examining biological aspects of risk for mood and anxiety disorders in children. Such work has major public impact. By identifying biological risks in children, information on novel treatments and preventative interventions will emerge. Given the understanding of most chronic mental illnesses as developmental disorders, such information holds the hope of dramatically influencing the mental well-being of many individuals. This project encompasses work examining the degree to which neurocognitive profiles vary among children and adolescents stratified with respect to personal and family history of mood and anxiety disorders. For these studies, personal history is defined based on early-childhood temperament. In a second protocol, we are acquiring fMRI data from a subset of these subjects. We have expanded our efforts in these protocols to encompass studies in juveniles across the full span of childhood and adolescence. Thus, one set of studies is based among young adults who have been prospectively followed for more than two decades. A second set of studies is based in school-aged children who are now approaching adolescence. In both sets of studies, as well as the larger series of studies in this project, considerable progress continues to be made. Studies on temperamental risk continue to dominate activities during the past year, as they had in the few years immediately prior. Thus, in this past year, studies on temperament occupy approximately 90% of all resources devoted to research on risk. During the past year, we spent most of our efforts on collecting data in a childhood cohort, where the subjects are now approximately 15 years old.  Our work in this cohort is now consistently replicating findings in an older cohort.  In both cohorts, our work demonstrates the persistent influence of temperament on risk into for psychopathology. In this past year, we have focused most of our efforts on identifying neurocognitive factors that isolate subsets of children with particular temperaments who face the greatest risk for psychopathology.  This has generated a steady stream of brain-imaging papers in both of these cohorts. Finally, other questions relate to the identification of factors that differentiate among children who are at high risk yet remain resilient from those who are at risk but manifest problems. Work in this project over the next few years is designed to address these questions. Problems with anxiety tend to run in families. Thus, anxiety often occurs among children born to parents with anxiety disorders as well as in children born to parents with major depressive disorder (MDD). In adults, MDD involves dysfunction in prefrontal brain regions that regulate attention to emotional stimuli. These abnormalities: i) have been found primarily in adults with specific familial forms of MDD, ii) persist after recovery from MDD, and iii) relate to anxiety. In adults, some data suggest that anxiety disorders are also associated with prefrontal dysfunction. However, findings in anxiety appear most strongly related to attention, whereas findings in MDD appear most strongly related to memory. This has stimulated attempts to dissociate factors in children associated with risk for anxiety as opposed to MDD. This protocol is attempting to dissociate these aspects of risk, through behavioral and fMRI studies of emotion regulation in high and low-risk adolescents. In general, research in this area continues to occupy a shrinking amount of resources in our group. Finally, our most in-depth studies focus on temperament, particularly the temperament of 'behavioral inhibition.' This work is made possible through our strong collaborative relationship with Dr. Nathan Fox at the University of Maryland. Our studies in this area continued to grow and expand this year, as they had done in the immediately prior years. Dr. Fox has followed cohorts of approximately 600 infants as they passed though childhood. These children have received repeated assessments of their temperament. Temperament classifications in the sample during infancy and early childhood have been shown to predict behavior later in life. We have also completed a series of investigations in this sample. Results from these studies support the conclusions generated in other research within our group. Namely, this work establishes the presence of strong, consistent associations between the presence of and risk factors for mental illness in children and the presence of perturbed brain function.In the past year, our group continued to have significant success in charting relationships between temperament and brain function. We continue to publish widely in this area, having published more than 10 papers in this area during the past year, and we have acquired data from many subjects during the past 12 months. During the next year, we plan to continue to report results from completed research. This includes reports on subjects who now are in their late-20's, examining the manner in which early temperament relates to later brain function and psychopathology, expressed in early adulthood. Finally, we have completed studies in the younger cohort, with assessments when the subjects were approximately 13 years old. This led to many papers in various stages of completion. This includes reports from studies both in late adolescents and in pre-adolescent children. Most importantly, we are in the midst of preparing papers that will report data from imaging studies in this younger cohort of pre-adolescents. Overall, the results from these studies show that the seeds of temperament continue to be expressed throughout development. Behaviorally, these seeds are expressed in measures of task performance and signs of psychopathology. From a brain-function perspective, these seeds are expressed in measures of electrophysiology and fMRI. Moreover, these measures of brain function mediate and moderate the relationships between temperament and psychopathology. As such, the studies provide important information on understanding risk for psychopathology.","13 year old;15 year old;Address;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Amygdaloid structure;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Area;Attention;base;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral inhibition;Biological;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Child;Childhood;Classification;cohort;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Data Reporting;design;Development;developmental disease;early childhood;Electrophysiology (science);emerging adult;emotion regulation;Emotional;emotional stimulus;experience;Exposure to;Face;Family;Family history of;Foxes;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;high risk;imaging study;indexing;Individual;infancy;Infant;Investigation;Life;Major Depressive Disorder;Maryland;Measures;Mediating;Medical;Memory;Mental disorders;Mood Disorders;Neurocognitive;novel;Paper;Parents;Prefrontal Cortex;Preventive Intervention;programs;prospective;Protocols documentation;Psychopathology;Publishing;Recording of previous events;Recovery;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;Resources;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Running;Sampling;School-Age Population;Seeds;Series;severe mental illness;social;Stimulus;Stream;success;Task Performances;Temperament;Testing;Universities;Well in self;Work;young adult;","FMRI STUDIES OF RISK FOR MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS IN CHILDREN",n/a,"NIMH","9568253","","",1ZIAMH002782-16,1,ZIA,MH,002782,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416709","PINE, DANIEL ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1274032,
"Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Epilepsy;Mental Health;Neurodegenerative;Neurosciences","1.	Critical brain dynamics are increasingly recognized to be important in cortex function.  We have expanded on our previous finding of neuronal avalanches maintained during the resting state.  We now have demonstrated the first study on linking deviations in avalanche dynamics with basal ganglia dysfunction in an animal model of Tourettes syndrome. See, 'A low-correlation resting state of the striatum that suppresses involuntary movements during cortical avalanches,' by Klaus and Plenz (2016), PloS Biology: Author SummaryEven in the absence of apparent motor output, the brain produces a rich repertoire of neuronal activity patterns known as resting state activity. In the outer layer of the cortex, resting state patterns emerge as neuronal avalanches, precisely scale-invariant spatiotemporal bursts that often engage large populations of neurons. Little is known about how the brain suppresses involuntary movements during such activity. Here, we show that the striatum, which is part of the cortex-basal ganglia loop, maintains a low-correlation state during resting activity. By using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches with pharmacological manipulations, we demonstrate that the precise configuration of this low-correlation state effectively contributes to involuntary movements. Nonselective blockade of intra-striatal inhibition abolished the low-correlation striatal resting state, barely affected cortical avalanches, and led to involuntary movements at low rate. In contrast, selectively reducing striatal interneuron inhibition strongly affected cortical avalanches and triggered involuntary movements at high rate while maintaining a relatively decorrelated striatal resting state. Our results demonstrate the importance of different inhibitory striatal circuits in the suppression of involuntary movements and suggest that the precise spatiotemporal configuration of striatal activity plays an active role in the regulation of cortical resting state activity and motor control.2.	We published a new approach to predict the size of future neuronal avalanches with wide implications including earthquake forecasting.  See Temporal correlations in neuronal avalanche occurrence, by Lombardi, F., Herrmann, H. J., Plenz,D.,  and L. de Arcangelis (2016):AbstractOngoing cortical activity consists of sequences of synchronized bursts, named neuronal avalanches, whose size and duration are power law distributed. These features have been observed in a variety of systems and conditions, at all spatial scales, supporting scale invariance, universality and therefore criticality. However, the mechanisms leading to burst triggering, as well as the relationship between bursts and quiescence, are still unclear. The analysis of temporal correlations constitutes a major step towards a deeper understanding of burst dynamics. Here, we investigate the relation between avalanche sizes and quiet times, as well as between sizes of consecutive avalanches recorded in cortex slice cultures. We show that quiet times depend on the size of preceding avalanches and, at the same time, influence the size of the following one. Moreover we evidence that sizes of consecutive avalanches are correlated. In particular, we show that an avalanche tends to be larger or smaller than the following one for short or long time separation, respectively. Our analysis represents the first attempt to provide a quantitative estimate of correlations between activity and quiescence in the framework of neuronal avalanches and will help to enlighten the mechanisms underlying spontaneous activity.3.	We published the first quantitative assessment of anti-epileptic drug action using the framework of critical brain dynamics in humans suffering from intractable epilepsy.  Data were obtained from a data repository and consisted of multi-day recordings from 10 patients undergoing presurgical monitoring at the Epilepsy Center of the University Hospital of Freiburg.  See, 'Quantifying antiepileptic drug effects using intrinsic excitability measures,' by Meisel et al. (2016), Epilepsia:AbstractPathologic increases in excitability levels of cortical tissue commonly underlie the initiation and spread of seizure activity in patients with epilepsy. By reducing the excitability levels in neural tissue, antiepileptic drug (AED) pharmacotherapy aims to reduce seizure severity and frequency. However, AEDs may also bring about adverse effects, which have been reported to increase with higher AED load. Measures that monitor the dose-dependent effects of AEDs on cortical tissue and quantify its excitability level are therefore of prime importance for efficient clinical care and treatment but have been difficult to identify. Here, we systematically analyze continuous multiday electrocorticography (ECoG) data from 10 patients under different levels of AED load and derive the recently proposed intrinsic excitability measures (IEMs) from different brain regions and across different frequency bands. We find that IEMs are significantly negatively correlated with AED load (prescribed daily dose/defined daily dose). Furthermore, we demonstrate that IEMs derived from different brain regions can robustly capture global changes in the degree of excitability. These results provide a step toward the ultimate goal of developing a reliable quantitative measure of central physiologic effects of AEDs in patients with epilepsy.4.	In collaboration with Dr. Peter Basser's group (NICHD), we provided the first experimental proof of functional diffusion MRI to reliably identify hyper-excitable, abnormal brain activities.  See Assessing the sensitivity of diffusion MRI to detect neuronal activity directly, Bai et al. (2016) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA:AbstractFunctional MRI (fMRI) is widely used to study brain function in the neurosciences. Unfortunately, conventional fMRI only indirectly assesses neuronal activity via hemodynamic coupling. Diffusion fMRI was proposed as a more direct and accurate fMRI method to detect neuronal activity, yet confirmative findings have proven difficult to obtain. Given that the underlying relation between tissue water diffusion changes and neuronal activity remains unclear, the rationale for using diffusion MRI to monitor neuronal activity has yet to be clearly established. Here, we studied the correlation between water diffusion and neuronal activity in vitro by simultaneous calcium fluorescence imaging and diffusion MR acquisition. We used organotypic cortical cultures from rat brains as a biological model system, in which spontaneous neuronal activity robustly emerges free of hemodynamic and other artifacts. Simultaneous fluorescent calcium images of neuronal activity are then directly correlated with diffusion MR signals now free of confounds typically encountered in vivo. Although a simultaneous increase of diffusion-weighted MR signals was observed together with the prolonged depolarization of neurons induced by pharmacological manipulations (in which cell swelling was demonstrated to play an important role), no evidence was found that diffusion MR signals directly correlate with normal spontaneous neuronal activity. These results suggest that, whereas current diffusion MR methods could monitor pathological conditions such as hyperexcitability, e.g., those seen in epilepsy, they do not appear to be sensitive or specific enough to detect or follow normal neuronal activity.","Action Potentials;Adverse effects;Affect;Animal Model;Antiepileptic Agents;Basal Ganglia;base;Biological Markers;Biological Models;Biology;Brain;brain abnormalities;Brain region;Calcium;Cells;clinical care;Clinical Data;Clinical Treatment;Cognition;Collaborations;Communication;Complex;Corpus striatum structure;Correlation Studies;Coupling;Data;Data Set;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;diffusion weighted;Disease;Dose;Drug effect disorder;Earthquakes;Electrocorticogram;Epilepsy;Equilibrium;fluorescence imaging;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Gilles de la Tourette syndrome;Global Change;Goals;hemodynamics;Human;Image;In Vitro;in vitro activity;in vivo;information processing;insight;interdisciplinary approach;International;Interneurons;Intractable Epilepsy;Intramural Research Program;Involuntary Movements;Laboratories;Laws;Link;Measures;Mediating;Mental disorders;Methods;Monitor;Monkeys;Morphologic artifacts;motor control;Motor output;Movement;Names;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Neocortex;nervous system disorder;Neurons;Neurosciences;novel strategies;Pathologic;Patients;Pattern;Perception;Pharmacology;Pharmacotherapy;Physics;Physiological;Play;Population;Publishing;Rattus;Regulation;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;Rest;Rodent;Role;Seizures;Severities;Signal Transduction;Slice;spatiotemporal;Swelling;System;theories;Time;Tissues;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;University Hospitals;water diffusion;Work;","NEURONAL AVALANCHES IN THE NEOCORTEX",n/a,"NIMH","9569193","","",1ZIAMH002797-16,1,ZIA,MH,002797,16,,Unavailable,"","","",,"7512789","PLENZ, DIETMAR ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1637990,

One fifth of our COS cases have earlier forms of autism spectrum disorder, and one third have motor, speech, language, attention or impulse related developmental disorders (Rapoport et al., 2009; Driver et al., 2013). In contrast, the non-psychotic siblings do not have an elevated rate of early neurodevelopmental disorders. Cognitive studies within this protocol are being completed to obtain prospective measures of working memory.COS probands have significantly decreased hippocampal volume (Mattai et al., 2011). Studies of anatomic hippocampal development in the healthy siblings showed no deviance from that seen for the healthy controls however a study in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Chicago show anterior hippocampal shape deviation in COS, similar to that seen for adult onset subjects, which are also shared, more subtly, by healthy COS siblings (Johnson et al., 2013). A higher field of strength (7T) study of the hippocampus in COS, their non-psychotic siblings and healthy controls has just been completed. Strikingly, there are the most marked changes in CA1 and in the dentate gyrus which is important in several cognitive functions that are defective in schizophrenia (Zhou et al., in preparation). Similarly, recent analyses also show that COS probands and their siblings show cortical thinning in the siblings that is more marked than for controls and correlates with the siblings' symptoms of schizotypy (Watsky et al., 2016).We have studied the development and abnormal connectivity in COS patients and their healthy siblings. Such analyses, particularly in healthy siblings may highlight resilience factors or circuits in the brain that are relevant to early psychosis. A task related to functional MRI study in collaboration with Dr. Karen Berman, NIMH, has shown similar functional response during two working memory tasks for probands, healthy siblings and controls. Our data shows that probands, and to a lesser extent healthy siblings, demonstrate increased recruitment in several brain regions including the right DLPFC and parietal circuits suggesting a subtle functional endophenotype (Loeb et al., submitted). A recent study explored the small world networks properties using resting state fMRI data in COS patients which suggested loss of shorter connections while the longer connections were relatively preserved (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2014). A resting state fMRI study of COS, their siblings and controls in collaboration with Dr. Stephen Gotts, NIMH, found striking abnormalities in the integration of activation in cognitive/social circuitry and motor/sensory circuits (Berman et al., 2016). Interestingly, these abnormalities bear some similarity to those seen in autism (Gotts et al., in preparation). Several genetic studies are ongoing. There is a higher rate of rare copy number variants (CNVs), with 126 probands, involving 75 proband/sibling pairs, and access to the current Database of Genomic Variation of over 26,000 individuals. A total of 13% of COS probands carry a rare, disease related CNV including 5 cases with the 22q11 deletion. This represents a significantly higher incidence compared to that seen for healthy controls and to that for adult onset schizophrenia patients (p&lt;.05) (Ahn et al., 2013). Common variants may also be more salient for COS as indicated by a higher score for COS probands compared with their healthy siblings (Ahn et al., 2016). To better understand the heritability of COS, exomic sequencing of 73 trios is being completed in collaboration with Matthew State, MD, (UCSF). We are also finding an 11% rate of the same rare CNVs for a group of our patients with severe early onset non-schizophrenic disorders indicating the non-specificity of CNV risk. Extramural funding has just been approved for Dr. State and his group to carry out whole genome sequencing for our COS samples. These samples are currently being sequenced in the laboratory of Stephan Sanders and Mathew State, UCSF.An ongoing collaborative study with Dr. Ricardo Dolmetsch, Novartis Institute, is studying neuronal activation and neurite development from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons from our childhood onset schizophrenia patients. Patients with and without rare disease associated copy number variants (CNVs) are included. Contrast groups will include unrelated healthy controls, and healthy and affected family members (some healthy carriers of risk CNVs). Evidence from iPSC-derived neurons from 22q11 subjects indicated reduced L-type voltage gated calcium responses in pyramidal neurons (Psca et al. in preparation). A new study will compare changes in expression for iPSC derived neurons from our best responders and a matched group of poor clozapine responders. Other studies using our samples are finding iPSC derived neurons to show abnormality in resistance to infection (Passeri et al., 2016) or dysregulation of microRNA (Topol et al., 2016). The Dolmetsch collaborators have to date provided iPSCs for 36 of our subjects and we have established a publicly available repository for COS iPSCs.In collaboration with Dr. Hakon Hakornason at the Center for Applied Genomics, we have studied the broad clinical penetrance for five schizophrenia-related CNVs including some found to be higher in COS (Zhou et al., 2016). We have screened a clinical pediatric population of 61,000 children. Preliminary data shows over 80% likelihood of clinical impairment for carriers of 15q13.3 deletion, 22q11.2 duplication and 16p11.2 deletion (Ahn et al., submitted).Finally, we continue to explore COS patients who show a stronger clinical response to clozapine initially and higher long-term compliance with this medication than do later onset patients (Kasoff et al., 2016). These studies are of importance given the dearth of new treatments in child psychiatry (Merikangas et al., 2013; Rapoport et al., 2013). A case report series of five patients with remarkable clinical response to clozapine in comparison to other antipsychotics is in preparation (Broadnax et al. in preparation).","16p11.2;22q11;22q11.2;Adult;Affect;Age;Anatomy;Anterior;Antipsychotic Agents;Attention;autism spectrum disorder;Autistic Disorder;Biochemical;Biological;Biopsy;Brain;brain circuitry;Brain imaging;Brain region;Calcium;Case Study;Chicago;Child;Child Psychiatry;Childhood;Childhood Schizophrenia;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clozapine;Cognitive;cognitive function;Collaborations;collected works;Copy Number Polymorphism;cost;Data;Databases;dentate gyrus;Development;developmental disease;deviant;Diagnosis;Disease;Double-blind trial;early adolescence;Early Diagnosis;early onset;Early treatment;Employee Strikes;endophenotype;Evaluation;exome sequencing;Extramural Activities;Family member;Fibroblasts;follow-up;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding;Genetic;Genetic Risk;Genetic study;genome sequencing;genomic variation;Genomics;Goals;Growth;Heritability;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;Hippocampus (Brain);Impairment;Incidence;Individual;induced pluripotent stem cell;Institutes;Laboratories;Language;Matched Group;Measures;Medicine;Mental disorders;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Motor;National Institute of Mental Health;Neurites;Neurobiology;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurons;novel;Onset of illness;Oxytocin;Parietal;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Penetrance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Population;Preparation;proband;Property;prospective;Prospective Studies;Protocols documentation;psychologic;Psychotic Disorders;psychotic symptoms;Randomized;Rare Diseases;Recruitment Activity;Refractory;Reporting;repository;resilience;Resistance to infection;response;Rest;Risk;risk variant;Safety;Sampling;Schizophrenia;screening;Sensory;Series;severe mental illness;Shapes;Short-Term Memory;Siblings;Skin;social;Societies;Speech;Stem cells;Symptoms;Thinness;treatment strategy;Universities;Ursidae Family;Variant;voltage;whole genome;","CHILDHOOD ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA",n/a,"NIMH","9569191","","",1ZIAMH002581-27,1,ZIA,MH,002581,27,,Unavailable,"","","",,"2414847","RAPOPORT, JUDITH L.",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2552457,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Clinical Research;Genetics;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","This work is conducted under protocol 89-M-0006 (NCT00001246), and falls into two broad research themes:Theme 1: Studies of behavior and brain organization in typically-developing groupsRecruitmentDuring the last year, we completed phase 1 of a Bring Back Project which recruited individuals who had previously been studied during childhood by the Child Psychiatry Branch an average of 20 years ago. This project represents the longest known neuroimaging follow-up study of human brain development, and provides a unique opportunity to study how childhood brain organization relates to later outcomes in adulthood. We have seen a total of 170 individuals in phase 1, and are currently preparing to invite participants back for a second visit.Published Research FindingsWe have published two collaborative studies which harness the precious longitudinal neuroimaging data gathered by the Child Psychiatry Branch over the past 20 years. These studies were made possible by data sharing and pooling between our laboratory and three others engaged in similar longitudinal neuroimaging studies of brain development in health. By resolving patterns of global and regional brain development between childhood and adulthood that are replicable across four independent groups, our findings set a new bar of consistency and replicability in developmental neuroimaging research.To  present state-of-the art approaches to studying neuroanatomy using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we also combined seminal results from the Child Psychiatry Branch longitudinal neuroimaging project in a cross-laboratory review paper in Nature Neuroscience.Theme 2: Deep phenotypic studies of participants with sex chromosome aneuploidy syndromes (SCAs)RecruitmentDuring the last year, we completed a deep phenotyping study of individuals with XYY syndrome along with matched typically-developing controls. We have seen 65 individuals with XYY along with their family members, making this globally unique cohort the largest known group of XYY individuals with such comprehensive deep phenotypic data. A second clinical recruitment focus has involved collection of skin biopsies across individuals from nine different sex chromosome dosage groups, which are currently being profiled at several different genomic levels.These two projects represent the opening phase of an ongoing SCA study which will eventually include multiple other X and Y chromosome variations (e.g., XXY, XXX, etc.). Collectively, these studies are designed to expand on past work in SCA by gathering more comprehensive measures of brain structure and function, as well as providing more fine-grained information regarding the cognitive and behavioral variations that can be seen in SCA. These data will ultimately help to better define the developmental risks and resiliencies associated with X- and Y-chromosome dosage variation in humans, and identify neurobiological systems that might underpin these associations. We hope these insights will (i) improve accurate public and professional awareness of SCAs, (ii) help clinicians provide more targeted assessment and counseling to patient and families with SCA, and (iii) begin to identify biological markers with the potential to ultimately improve assessment, prediction and treatment of neurodevelopmental issues in SCA. More broadly, this work in the specific case of SCA will shed light on (i) the principles that organize genetic influences on brain and behavior in the context of neuropsychiatric impairment, and (ii) sex chromosome contributions to sex-differences in the brain, which are relevant for understanding the well-documented male-bias in risk for neurodevelopmental disorders more generally.Published Research FindingsWe have published two studies using existing neuroimaging data from an earlier phase of SCA research within the Child Psychiatry Branch. These data provide measures of brain anatomy across multiple different SCA groups and individuals without a SCA. Our studies have identified a set of brain regions that appear to be especially sensitive to SCA in terms of their anatomical development and represent promising new candidates in the search for neural systems that underpin some of the cognitive and behavioral changes that can be associated with SCA. In particular, we have focused this last year on clarifying SCA effects on folding of the cerebral cortex and regional anatomy of the cerebellum. Because SCAs exert a powerful effect on total brain volume, these focused studies have also required us to develop new statistical methods for proper control of total brain size effects when studying regional brain anatomy. These methods will be broadly useful to all researchers comparing groups that differ in total brain size and therefore have a large impact beyond the field of SCA.","Adult;Age;Anatomy;Architecture;Awareness;Back;Behavior;Behavioral;behavioral study;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;Biopsy;Brain;brain behavior;Brain region;brain size;brain volume;Cereals;Cerebellum;Cerebral cortex;Child Psychiatry;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Data;Cognition;Cognitive;cohort;Collection;Counseling;Data;Data Set;design;Detection;Development;Disease;dosage;falls;Family;Family member;Follow-Up Studies;Gene Expression;Genetic;Genomics;Goals;Health;healthy volunteer;Hereditary Disease;Human;Impairment;improved;Individual;insight;interest;Knowledge;Laboratories;Light;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;male;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Nature;Neuraxis;Neuroanatomy;Neurobiology;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;neuroimaging;neuropsychiatric disorder;neuropsychiatric symptom;neuropsychiatry;Neurosciences;Outcome;Paper;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Phenotype;phenotypic data;Protocols documentation;Psychophysiology;Publishing;Recruitment Activity;Regional Anatomy;relating to nervous system;Research;Research Personnel;resilience;Risk;Seminal;Sex Behavior;Sex Characteristics;sex chromosome aneuploidy;Sex Chromosomes;sharing data;Skin;Statistical Methods;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Syndrome;System;Variant;Visit;Work;X Chromosome;XYY Karyotype;Y Chromosome;","DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROGENOMICS UNIT",n/a,"NIMH","9568282","","",1ZIAMH002949-02,1,ZIA,MH,002949,02,,Unavailable,"","","",,"14761200","RAZNAHAN, ARMIN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2349778,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision;Mental Health;Neurosciences","At the highest level of vision, perceiving complex objects, and distinguishing among those that overlap in appearance, e.g., we quickly distinguish any red tomato from any red apple, regardless of the variety, is done seemingly with ease. A half-century of behavioral, anatomical and physiological research has given rise to a hierarchical model of visual processing for objects. In this model the information about objects arises in a sequence of brain regions stretching from the occipital cortex, where simple features such as oriented edges or lines are represented, to the inferior temporal cortex called area TE where neurons represent conjunctions of visual features defining whole objects. Thus, the highest level of visual perception, perceiving complete integrated objects, is thought to take place in the inferior temporal lobe.A straightforward prediction from this model would be that area TE, in the monkey inferior temporal lobe, plays a key role in the categorization of complex stimuli including those having over-lapping features. Until recently it was thought that area TE represented the final stage for this hierarchical visual processing scheme. However, in the past two decades, there has been a disagreement about which rostral temporal lobe brain region, area TE on the lateral part of the temporal cortex or rhinal cortex on the ventro-medial part of the temporal cortex, represents the final stage of visual perception supporting the ability to recognize objects. it has been suggested that the rhinal cortex, which receives strong input from area TE, is important for recognition of complex objects or objects with feature ambiguity. Proponents for the rhinal cortex view argue that after removal of perirhinal cortex, monkeys are impaired in tasks requiring discrimination among stimuli with ambiguous or overlapping features. Skeptics argue that the experiments purporting to test for perception have been confounded by a memory demand. The monkeys have been asked to report whether objects presented in sequence with or without intervening objects are the same, i.e., does the test object match the sample or not. Hence deficits following removal of perirhinal cortex might have been due to a failure of memory, not perception.Recently we reported that monkeys with bilateral removal of area TE are only mildly impaired in performing categorical discriminations based on visual properties  e.g. cat vs. dog or car vs. truck. The impairment seemed less severe than would be predicted by the hierarchical model. We set out to test whether making the stimuli ambiguous would lead to a greater deficit than that seen when distinguishing dogs from cats or cars from trucks. We used stimuli with overlapping features. The stimuli were created by blending and warping cats with dogs in different proportions thus giving a range of category-ambiguous morphed images. We tested three groups of monkeys, one control group, one group in which area TE had been removed bilaterally, and one in which rhinal cortex had been removed bilaterally. We presented one image at a time. These stimuli were morphed (blended and warped) cats and dogs ranging between 0 and 100% dog, with a distribution biased around the category boundary (11 levels, 0, 25, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 75, 100% of dog). The monkey was trained to touch a bar to initiate a trial, and had to release the bar during one of two intervals; early (signaled by a red central dot) if it identified the stimulus as more cat-like, or late (signaled by a green central dot) if the stimulus was identified as more dog-like. If the monkey responded correctly, the color of the central dot turned into blue and liquid reward was given. We assessed performance on this task before and after bilateral TEO lesions.Because our task places no explicit demands on short-term memory, the monkey is comparing the current image against a stored template, any behavioral deficit produced by TE or rhinal lesions can be interpreted as a failure in categorization based on perceptual similarity. If rhinal cortex contains the neural machinery subserving the highest levels of visual perception, removal of this cortex might be expected to yield an even greater impairment with these stimuli than that observed after TE lesions. We found that the monkeys with the TE removals were able to do the categorization but they made considerably more errors than the control group. The rhinal group was indistinguishable from the control group. Thus in our testing it appears that monkeys area TE plays an important role in object discrimination, but that there are other areas of the brain that support this ability to distinguish or classify feature ambiguous stimuli, and it appears that rhinal cortex does not play a role in the perception of these objects. Given the results described above, we sought to carry out the same tests in monkeys that had area TEO, the architectonic brain region just behind (caudal to) area TE, removed. In the hierarchical model this area provides the visual information to area TE.  We reasoned that this removing this tissue would lead to an impairment in classifying our feature ambiguous cats/dogs. We analyzed the behavioral data for 4 days before the lesions, and four days afterwards. The percentage of response as dog-like for each morphed level was calculated and used as indicator of categorization accuracy. Our preliminary data suggest that the TEO lesions were showed poor categorization on the first day of post-lesion testing. In particular, the discriminability in the first day after lesion was significantly degraded when the morphing range was between 25-75%. As we previously observed in TE lesioned monkeys, the accuracy score improved over the first few days of exposure to the morphed stimuli, in this case recovering to pre-lesion levels of performance. We are now testing monkeys with combined TEO-TE removals. These monkeys are severely impaired in categorizing the morphed images, although they retain some ability to categorize pure dogs and cats.","Address;Anatomy;Appearance;Apple;Area;base;Behavior;Behavioral;Bilateral;Brain;Brain region;Canis familiaris;Categories;Code;cognitive process;Color;Complex;Control Groups;Data;Depressed mood;design;Discrimination;Elements;Emotional disorder;Esthesia;Event;Excision;experimental study;Exposure to;Failure;Family member;Feeling;Felis catus;Food;Image;Impairment;improved;Individual;Inferior;information model;information processing;Interneurons;Lateral;Lead;Learning;Lesion;Liquid substance;Memory;Modeling;Monkeys;Movement;Neurons;object perception;Occipital lobe;Perception;Performance;Physiologic pulse;Physiological;Play;Population;Process;Property;Psyche structure;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;response;Rewards;Role;Sampling;Scheme;sensory stimulus;Series;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;Stretching;Temporal Lobe;Testing;Time;Tissues;Tomatoes;Touch sensation;Training;Vision;Visual;visual coding;visual information;visual memory;visual object processing;Visual Perception;visual processing;visual stimulus;","NEURAL CODING OF VISUAL STIMULI",n/a,"NIMH","9570586","","",1ZIAMH002032-41,1,ZIA,MH,002032,41,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6571765","RICHMOND, BARRY J",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1620974,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Mental Health;Neurosciences","To be effective in modulating behavior information arising in the cerebral cortex about the value of the behavior must pass through the subcortical striatum. It is known from many experiments including ours that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is important for distinguishing among rewards with different values. The OFC sends information into the striatum, specifically the ventromedial striatum. The ventral striatum is part of the brains reward circuitry, a circuit that also includes the amygdala, the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the globus pallidus, the ventral pallidum, the substantia nigra, the ventrotegmental area and the mediodorsal nucleus of thalamus.Tonically active neurons (TANs) are cholinergic striatal interneurons that are interesting because they seem to process reward-related and motivational information.  It is thought that they help control the information that is projected out of the striatum through their contacts with the projection neurons, the medium spiny neurons. The responses of TANs were originally described as stereotyped conditioned stimuli (CS) predicting appetitive or aversive outcomes. The CS provoked a pause followed by a pulse, with pause plus pulse lasting a few hundred milliseconds.Given the rich encoding of reward value in OFC, we hypothesized that the OFC target in the ventral striatum might also have a rich encoding in our task. We recorded the responses of TANs in two monkeys that were given the option to accept or reject an offered reward that changed with every trial. The monkey began a trial by touching a bar.  A visual cue appeared indicating which of several possible rewards was being offered. The monkey could reject the offer or could accept, after which the offered reward was delivered. On each trial, the offer was chosen randomly from the combination of a 2, 4, or 6 drops of reward liquid and a discounting delay of 1, 4 or 7 seconds. The monkeys were more likely to accept big rewards delivered immediately and reject small rewards for which there was a long waiting time. Intermediate combinations led to intermediate probability of acceptance.  A reinforcement learning model showed the acceptance rates were related to a value the animal assigned to each offer.Just after the visual cue appeared, the TANs responded with a time-varying profile depending on the offered reward.  For 40% of the TANs, the response was for some values a pause in the ongoing activity followed by a pulse of activity, and for other values there was a pulse first, followed by a pause, i.e., the responses looked like a see-saw with one part going up that other down by the same amount, or vice-versa. Because of this see-saw type of response these neurons could appear to have no change in activity. However, if the temporal modulation, pause-pulse -> pulse-pause is quantified using principal component analysis the responses show a powerful reward-dependent modulation, i.e. these neurons use a temporal code. The principal component analysis also showed that the other TANs were using a code by modulating either the pause or the pulse. Thus, all of the TANs can be regarded as having a temporally modulated neural code. This is perhaps the first time that this type of temporal coding mechanism has been observed anywhere in the brain. The temporal modulated response give the TANS a mechanism to reliably synchronize the activity of the targeted elements, medium spiny neurons and striatal dopamine terminals. These results provide strong evidence supporting a functional role of TANs for cognition and regulating behavior, and we have shown how these neurons have responses that are well-suited to provide precise, reproducible coding for different reward values, just the type of synchronization that is needed to promote organized motor behavior.Using chemogenetic tools such as DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to modulate neural activity in selected brain regions repeatedly and non-invasively is becoming a powerful means for investigating the connection between neural activity and behavior. Activating the DREADD is done with clozapine-N-oxide. If injected systemically it acts specifically where the DREADD is expressed. For example, we showed recently that reversibly inactivating OFC during a reward value experiment similar to that described above for the TANs leads to a loss of behavioral sensitivity to differences in rewards. Despite the success we had in the OFC experiment, there are several technical steps that need improvement. Ideally, we would like to know whether the injections of virus were made accurately into the targeted tissue region, and we would like to know that the gene for the DREADD in this case is producing the desired molecular product. To visualize the site of the DREADD viral construct at the time of surgery, we co-injected Mn2+ with the virus can be used for post-surgery verification of injection sites. Mn2+ elicits an MRI hyper-signal lasting up to a day after injection, showing that this procedure is valuable. To be sure that the Mn2+ does not interfere with the infectious titer of DREADD-containing virus, we added 10mM of MnCl2 to viral suspension, after which we saw that the titer was stable for at least 6 hours at room temperature. To test in vivo, 5 l of lentivirus was mixed with concentrations of MnCl2 of 0.1, 1.0, and 10mM, and injected into monkey cortex; all concentrations resulted in detectable MRI hyper-signal. Subsequent histological examination of the tissue showed that that coverage and penetrance were not affected by addition of MnCl2.We have shown that in vivo visualization of DREADD expression can be achieved using radiolabeled clozapine (C11-CLZ).  Clozapine is not typically used as an inducer due to its high affinity for several endogenous receptors. Recent findings suggest that CNO converts to clozapine in vivo, in both rats and monkeys. We sought to determine whether CNO-derived clozapine binds DREADDs expressed in the rhesus macaque brain. We expressed inhibitory DREADD, hM4Di, in the right amygdala of two rhesus macaques. This was achieved using lentivirus (130  200 uL), which expressed the designer receptor under the control of a human synapsin promoter. Then, using PET imaging, we visualized DREADDs in vivo with radiolabeled clozapine (C11-CLZ). C11-CLZ was used as the radioligand due to its high affinity for DREADDs and ability to cross the blood brain barrier. In both monkeys, PET imaging revealed increased C11-CLZ signal at the site of injection compared to non-target regions, confirming lateralized expression of DREADDs. Signal was also observed in other parts of the brain, particularly those rich in dopamine receptors  a known endogenous target of clozapine  such as the striatum. In a second experiment, CNO (10 mg/kg) was administered 10 minutes before the radioligand. We found that C11-CLZ uptake was blocked by CNO, resulting in reduced signal in the region of DREADD expression. Because CNO binds to the receptors selectively, this localized reduction was expected. However, we also observed a reduction in signal in non-target regions. The result of the CNO blocking study is consistent with what would be expected following the block of radiolabeled clozapine by unlabeled clozapine (i.e. a self-block) and supports the interpretation that CNO is converted to clozapine in sufficient quantities to produce detectable binding at endogenous receptors. These experiments suggest that activation of the DREADD could be accomplished through administration at a very low dose, likely subclinical, dose of clozapine.","Ablation;Affinity;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Anterior;Area;base;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral Mechanisms;behavioral study;Binding;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Brain region;Cerebral cortex;cholinergic neuron;cingulate cortex;Clozapine;Code;Cognition;Corpus striatum structure;cost;Cues;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;Desire for food;discount;discounting;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;Dose;Drops;Drug abuse;drug of abuse;Elements;Equilibrium;experimental study;Feeling;Feeling hopeless;Genes;Globus Pallidus;Hippocampus (Brain);Histologic;Hour;Human;Hunger;Imagery;in vivo;Injectable;Injection of therapeutic agent;Interneurons;Learning;Liquid substance;Macaca mulatta;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;manganese chloride;Medial Dorsal Nucleus;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;millisecond;Modeling;Molecular;Monkeys;Motivation;Motor;neuromechanism;Neurons;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Oxides;Penetrance;Performance;Physiologic pulse;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prefrontal Cortex;Principal Component Analysis;Probability;Procedures;Process;promoter;Psychological reinforcement;Radiolabeled;radioligand;Rattus;receptor;relating to nervous system;Reproducibility;response;reward circuitry;Rewards;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;social;Stereotyping;Stimulus;Subfamily lentivirinae;Substantia nigra structure;success;Suspensions;Synapsins;System;Temperature;Testing;Thalamic structure;Theoretical Studies;Thirst;Time;Tissues;tool;Touch sensation;uptake;Ventral Striatum;Viral;Virus;Visual;Work;","NEURAL MECHANISMS OF MOTIVATION AND REWARD",n/a,"NIMH","9570587","","",1ZIAMH002619-26,1,ZIA,MH,002619,26,,Unavailable,"","","",,"6571765","RICHMOND, BARRY J",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1620974,
"Aging;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities;Depression;Estrogen;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Serious Mental Illness","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00030147, NCT00060736, NCT00001231, and NCT00001322. The menopause transition is accompanied by a decrease in quality of life (QOL) measures for some women, and several randomized controlled trials of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) have targeted QOL as a potential indication for HT. We have characterized the impact of Perimenopausal depression (PMD) on QOL, disability, social adjustment and role functioning. Our findings show that PMD is accompanied by a decreased QOL, decreased social adjustment and impaired role functioning comparable to depression and anxiety disorders occurring at other stages of a womans life. Neither perimenopausal reproductive status alone nor the presence of hot-flushes had a significant negative impact on QOL measures. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the clinical characteristics we identified reflect pre-existing risk factors for depression during the perimenopause or the effects of a current depression. The latter question was recently clarified by the results of our longitudinal study of women as they transition through the perimenopause. Specifically, we examined whether the changes in negative life events and declines in QOL measures observed in cross-sectional studies were antecedents of PMD or reflect the effects of the presence of depression. Thus, we prospectively evaluated healthy women longitudinally across the menopause transition. Seventy asymptomatic, premenopausal women, ages 41-55 years, were monitored longitudinally for an average of 5.2 years until 6-12 months after their final menses (FMP). Outcome measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), as well as standardized measures of QOL, marital satisfaction, and life events. Twenty-eight episodes of major  and minor  depression occurred in twenty-two women, twenty-seven of these episodes occurred in the 2-years surrounding the FMP. Thus confirming reports by our group and others of the clustering of depressions during the late menopause transition a time associated with declining levels of ovarian estradiol secretion. During the four years prior to the FMP, compared to women who remained asymptomatic, women with PMD reported significantly lower life satisfaction in PMD but did not report significant differences in overall QOL, marital satisfaction, experience of personal loss, or negative life events. Thus, these data suggest that negative life events and decreased QOL/marital dissatisfaction do not uniformly precede the onset of PMD. Further, the relative absence of antecedent social or environmental in PMD suggests a more specific role for hormonal events in the triggering of PMD. 	A role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by the clustering of depressive episodes during the late menopause transition (the stage of ovarian aging associated with maximal decline of ovarian estradiol secretion) and by estradiols antidepressant efficacy in PMD.  Additionally, we have completed a subsequent placebo-controlled study examining the effects on mood and behavior in women with PMD of estradiol and two compounds: the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM), raloxifene and a phytoestrogen (plant-derived estrogen-like compounds). In this study we replicated our previous findings that estradiol therapy is effective in the treatment of PMD; however, neither raloxifene nor the phytoestrogen showed significant effects on symptoms in PMD. Nonetheless, there is no direct evidence that estradiol withdrawal precipitates depressive episodes in those women who develop depression during the perimenopause.  In our studies of the effects of estradiol withdrawal on mood, we first examined the effects of inducing estradiol withdrawal and hypogonadism on mood symptoms in asymptomatic premenopausal women participating in our gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist protocol. We observed only four women (5.6% of the sample) who reported Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores > 10 (suggestive of clinically significant symptoms of depression), and in only one of these women did the elevated BDI scores persist beyond two weeks duration. Neither plasma estradiol levels nor the severity of hot flushes correlated with mood rating scores.  Thus, in otherwise healthy women the induction of neither hypogonadism nor hot flushes (with an accompanying sleep disturbance) uniformly precipitates depressive symptoms. These data, and the results of epidemiologic data confirming that the majority of women do not develop depression during the menopause transition, led to our examining whether women with a past PMD are differentially sensitive to the effects of estradiol withdrawal.	We next evaluated the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in women with and those without a past PMD.  In this study, asymptomatic postmenopausal women who experienced a depression during the menopause transition and asymptomatic postmenopausal women with no past depression received a standard dose of estradiol (100 mcg per day).  After three weeks all women were randomly assigned under double-blind (DB) conditions to either continue estradiol (DB ET) or switch to placebo (DB placebo, estradiol withdrawal).  If estradiol withdrawal was a relevant physiologic event to trigger depression, then one would predict that depressive symptoms would develop in those women randomized to placebo.  Additionally, if women who develop depression during the perimenopause are differentially susceptible to the mood destabilizing effects of estradiol withdrawal, then mood symptoms should emerge in the women with past PMD but not the controls randomized to DB placebo.	Results demonstrate that estradiol withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with past PMD (n = 26), but not in those without such a history (n = 30).  None of the women reported depressive symptoms during open label estradiol. Women with past PMD who were crossed over from estradiol to placebo experienced a significant increase in depression symptom severity. Women with past PMD who continued on estradiol and all control women remained asymptomatic. Importantly, women with past PMD and control women had similar hot-flush severity and plasma estradiol levels during placebo and, therefore, neither differences in hot-flushes (and the attendant sleep-disturbance) nor peripheral estradiol levels accounts for the differential response to estradiol withdrawal. In women with past PMD, the recurrence of depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women. These data also suggest that women with a history of PMD should be alert to the risk of recurrent depression when discontinuing hormone therapy.  	In collaboration with David Goldmans laboratory at NIAAA, we are currently investigating the effects of estradiol withdrawal on gene expression (RNA-seq) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) obtained from women with past PMD and controls who had the presence and absence, respectively, of estradiol withdrawal-induced depressive symptoms confirmed in the clinical study. Finally, we will explore whether the estradiol withdrawal signal is mediated by ER alpha or beta (or both) by employing a selective ER beta agonist.  These data could identify a promising new class of therapeutic agents that are safer and more acceptable than estrogen and potentially lack the side effects or withdrawal syndromes associated with traditional psychotropics.  Additionally, it is possible that the selectivity of these compounds for estrogen receptor alpha and beta may identify the mechanisms of efficacy of estradiol on specific target symptoms.","Accounting;Acute;Adverse effects;Affective;Age;age effect;Aging;Agonist;Antidepressive Agents;Anxiety Disorders;Appearance;base;Beck depression inventory;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological;Blinded;burden of illness;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Research;clinically significant;Collaborations;Communities;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Depressed mood;depressive symptoms;Development;Direct Costs;disability;Dose;Double-Blind Method;DSM-IV;Endocrine;epidemiologic data;epidemiology study;Estradiol;Estrogen Receptor alpha;Estrogen Receptor beta;Estrogens;Event;experience;Facilities and Administrative Costs;Gene Expression;Goals;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone;Heart Diseases;Hormonal;hormone therapy;Hormones;Hot flushes;Hypogonadism;Impairment;Interview;Laboratories;Life;Link;Longevity;Longitudinal Studies;lymphoblastoid cell line;Major Depressive Disorder;Measures;Mediating;Medical;Menopause;Menstruation;Mental Depression;Metabolic syndrome;middle age;minor depressive disorder;Monitor;Mood Disorders;mood symptom;Moods;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;novel therapeutic intervention;open label;Osteoporosis;Outcome Measure;Ovarian;ovarian failure;Perimenopause;Peripheral;Physiological;Phytoestrogens;placebo controlled study;Placebos;Plants;Plasma;Postmenopause;Precipitation;Predisposition;Premenopause;Prevalence;prospective;Protocols documentation;psychobiology;Quality of life;Raloxifene;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recording of previous events;Recurrence;recurrent depression;Regulation;Reporting;reproductive;reproductive function;Reproductive Periods;response;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;satisfaction;Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators;Severities;Signal Transduction;Sleep disturbances;social;Social Adjustment;Source;Span 20;standardize measure;Structure;Substance Withdrawal Syndrome;Suggestion;suicide rate;Symptoms;Therapeutic Agents;Time;transcriptome sequencing;Withdrawal;Woman;Work;","PSYCHOBIOLOGY AND TREATMENT OF PERIMENOPAUSAL MOOD DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9568247","","",1ZIAMH002537-28,1,ZIA,MH,002537,28,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416711","SCHMIDT, PETER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,578224,
"Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Contraception/Reproduction;Depression;Estrogen;Genetics;Major Depressive Disorder;Maternal Health;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Serious Mental Illness","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00005011, NCT00056901, NCT00059228, NCT00082043, NCT00100360, NCT00001177, NCT00001259, and NCT00001481.Overlapping co-morbidities between premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and postpartum depression (PPD) have led to suggestions that these disorders represent a continuum of risk and a shared pathophysiology. Thus, we examined the past histories of women with PPD in a clinic-based sample of women meeting criteria for PMDD. Our data demonstrate that PMDD and PPD do not co-occur at a greater frequency than observed in community samples of women, and, therefore, do not suggest that PMDD and PPD share similar pathophysiology beyond both being ovarian-steroid triggered mood disorders. 	The linkage between the onset of symptoms and the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle suggests a role for ovarian steroid secretion in the pathophysiology of PMDD.  Our studies have documented that PMDD symptoms are eliminated by ovarian suppression and stimulated by administration of ovarian steroids, yet appear in the context of levels of ovarian steroids indistinguishable from those in women without PMDD.  Thus, PMDD symptoms could be precipitated by either an acute increase in the levels of ovarian steroids or the presence of stable levels of ovarian steroids above a critical threshold that play a permissive role in the expression of an underlying infradian affective pacemaker. We attempted to define the kinetics of the ovarian steroid event relevant to triggering PMDD symptoms. Women with PMDD who responded to treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist-induced ovarian suppression (i.e., PMDD symptom remission) then were exposed to three months of combined continuous estradiol and progesterone treatment (E/P). If the change in hormone level is critical, then we would expect the initial recurrence of PMDD symptoms in the first month of E/P exposure followed by a remission of PMDD symptoms once ovarian steroid levels were stable and maintained during months 2-3 of hormone treatment. Alternatively, if the E/P exposure above threshold levels is the key physiologic event to produce episodic cyclic symptoms during the luteal phase, then we would predict recurrent episodes of affective symptoms reminiscent of luteal phase symptom cyclicity during each of the three months of stable E/P levels. We demonstrated that the change in levels of E/P from low to high, and not the steady state levels, was associated with the onset of PMDD symptoms. Although the mechanisms underlying the mood destabilizing effects of ovarian steroids in PMDD remain to be better characterized, as does the source of susceptibility to this trigger, our findings provide a new target on which interventions could be focused (namely increasing neurosteroid levels from the follicular to the luteal phase). To that end, we completed a pilot study evaluating (under blinded conditions) the effects of inhibiting the production of the neurosteroid, allopregnanolone (a derivative of progesterone that is implicated in the alterations of neurotransmitter function that could lead to PMDD). After successful elimination of the luteal phase increase in allopregnanolone (despite maintaining normal progesterone levels), the emergence of luteal phase affective symptoms in PMDD were prevented. These findings have led to our plans to conduct a larger placebo-controlled treatment trial investigating the effects of stabilizing neurosteroid levels in women with PMDD. 	Our findings to date suggest that women with PMDD have a differential behavioral response to ovarian steroids (as demonstrated in our GnRH agonist studies) and the relevance of neural differences in the response to ovarian steroids with consequent differential activation (described above) of brain networks that mediate the affective responsivity of women with PMDD.  These data set the stage for the performance of in vitro cellular studies of ovarian steroid responsivity in women with PMDD. The observed differential sensitivity could be due to an as yet unrecognized aspect of hormonal signaling or a difference in cellular response. Isolating the molecular mechanism of the observed differential response is key to interventional approaches and, therefore, we have moved to cellular models in which the molecular machinery of response (i.e., ovarian steroid receptors) is present.  In collaboration with Dr. David Goldman at NIAAA, we developed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from women with and without PMDD who have participated in our GnRH agonist-induced ovarian suppression studies.  The behavioral outcomes observed during these protocols serve to refine the hormone-sensitive phenotype beyond simply the established clinical diagnoses.  Women are selected retrospectively, based on the observed behavioral response to the hormone manipulation (i.e., occurrence of mood symptoms proximate to hormone manipulation in women with PMDD, or no changes in mood in the matched controls).  Our in vitro experimental strategies attempt to recapitulate the endocrine events that trigger mood symptoms in women with PMDD.	In this study, we found mRNA expression for estrogen receptor (ER) ESR1 (ERalpha) and ESR2 (ERbeta) and the progesterone membrane receptors PGRMC1 & 2. In untreated LCLs, our results overall suggest a divergence between mRNA and protein for the same genes.  Pathway analyses of the LCL transcriptome revealed, among others, over-expression of ESC/E(Z) complex genes (an ovarian steroid-regulated gene silencing complex) in untreated LCLs from women with PMDD, with more than half of these genes over-expressed as compared to controls. This pattern of increased ESC/E(Z) mRNA expression was confirmed in the larger replication cohort by qRT-PCR. In contrast, protein expression of ESC/E(Z) genes was decreased in untreated PMDD LCLs.  Finally, mRNA expression of several ESC/E(Z) complex genes were increased by P in controls only and decreased by E in PMDD LCLs.  	Our findings provide the first evidence of a plausible biological substrate for the differential behavioral response to E/P in women with PMDD.  Indeed, these data suggest that women with PMDD have an intrinsic abnormality in their epigenetic capacity that could manifest in an alteration in their ability to translate environmental events into long-term changes in gene expression. Several issues require future exploration and are currently being pursued including a new initiative (supported by an NIH Bench to Bedside award), to employ these same methods to cell lines obtained from women with and without postpartum depression (PPD) and in women with first-onset postpartum psychosis. Finally, we examined the possibility that women with PMDD metabolize steroids differently than asymptomatic controls and, therefore, produce a different profile of neuroactive steroid metabolites that contributes to the onset of PMDD symptoms. Pharmacometabolomic studies (employing liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy) were performed in women with PMDD who respond to Lupron with elimination of symptoms and who experience return of symptoms during progesterone (P) or estradiol (E) replacement, as well as controls who experience no change in mood during the identical experimental paradigm. Importantly, no differences in the formation of P-derived neurosteroids were observed in this sample of women studied under controlled hormone. However, despite identical exposures to E and P, women with PMDD were distinguished by differences in their profiles of sulfated steroid metabolites. Relative to the Lupron condition (i.e., suppressed steroid secretion), women with PMDD were distinguished from controls by a significantly attenuated sulfotransferase activity which also could contribute to the differential steroid sensitivity in PMDD.","Accounting;Acute;Affective;Affective Symptoms;Agonist;Allopregnanolone;Appearance;Attention;Attenuated;Award;base;Behavior;Behavioral;behavioral outcome;behavioral response;bench to bedside;Biological;Blinded;Brain;burden of illness;Cell Line;Cell model;Childbirth;Chronic Disease;Clinic;clinical Diagnosis;Clinical Protocols;cognitive function;cohort;Collaborations;Communities;Comorbidity;Complex;Data;Data Set;depressive symptoms;Development;Direct Costs;Disease;Disease remission;Enantone;Endocrine;Epigenetic Process;ESR1 gene;ESR2 gene;Estradiol;Estrogen Receptors;Event;experience;Exposure to;Facilities and Administrative Costs;Frequencies;Functional disorder;functional genomics;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Silencing;Genes;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone;Health;Hormonal;Hormone Receptor;hormone sensitivity;Hormone use;Hormones;Hypothyroidism;In Vitro;Infant;Intervention;Investigation;Kinetics;Lead;Liquid Chromatography;Longevity;Luteal Phase;lymphoblastoid cell line;Major Depressive Disorder;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;meetings;Membrane;Menstrual cycle;Mental Depression;Messenger RNA;Methods;Molecular;Mood Disorders;mood symptom;Moods;Morbidity - disease rate;mortality;mRNA Expression;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;Nature;neurosteroids;Neurotransmitters;Ovarian;Ovarian Ablation;overexpression;Pacemakers;Pathway Analysis;Pattern;Performance;Perimenopause;Periodicity;permissiveness;Pharmacometabolomics;Phenotype;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Placebo Control;Play;Postpartum Depression;Postpartum Period;Predisposition;premenstrual dysphoric disorder;Premenstrual syndrome;prevent;Production;Progesterone;protein expression;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Psychotic Disorders;Publications;Puerperium;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;receptor;Recording of previous events;Recurrence;relating to nervous system;Reporting;reproductive;Reproductive Periods;Research Design;response;Risk;Role;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Source;Steroid Receptors;steroid sulfate;Steroids;Stimulus;Suggestion;sulfotransferase;Symptoms;System;transcriptome;Translating;treatment trial;United States National Institutes of Health;Woman;Work;","REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE RELATED MOOD DISORDERS-DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY",n/a,"NIMH","9568264","","",1ZIAMH002865-12,1,ZIA,MH,002865,12,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416711","SCHMIDT, PETER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,578224,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Cerebrovascular;Contraception/Reproduction;Depression;Estrogen;Genetics;Mental Health;Mind and Body;Neurosciences","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocols: NCT00026832, NCT00100360, NCT00001177, and NCT00001322.Previous studies have identified the presence of abnormalities in resting state activity and reward processing in mood disorders.  Indeed, altered resting state function represents an intriguing possible explanation for the generation of ovarian hormone-related state changes characterized by predictable alterations in social, cognitive, and affective function in women with PMDD. Results from our resting state H215O PET studies in healthy premenopausal women (n = 40) demonstrate effects of both hypogonadism and ovarian steroids on resting rCBF in several brain regions, including BA25, insula, and medial PFC (mPFC).  Evidence also suggests that genomic variation in sex-steroid receptors or in the systems regulated by sex steroids may contribute to the ovarian hormone-sensitivity observed in PMDD. Thus, we examine the effects of common allelic variations in women during each of the hormonal conditions established within the GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism and ovarian steroid addback protocol. As a first pass, we have tested specific, common polymorphisms (BDNF Val66Met and COMT Val158Met) that are molecularly functional, and that are known to alter brain function, affect and cognition. In these studies, therefore, we employ these polymorphisms as probes for the involvement of these genes and the molecules they modulate in ovarian steroid behavioral/cognitive sensitivity observed in.First, we examined the interaction between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and ovarian hormones on PET measurements of rCBF and fMRI BOLD signal while women performed a well-established working memory (WM) task (i.e. the n-back). Preclinical studies have documented multiple sites of interaction between estradiol and BDNF: estradiol increases BDNF function by binding to a putative estrogen response element (ERE) on the BDNF gene and/or by inducing the BDNF receptor, TrkB, and estradiol and BDNF activate similar signaling cascades and pathways through estrogen receptors and TrkB; respectively. Additionally, both BDNF and estradiol alone facilitate neural activity in the hippocampus and conjointly influence neural growth, survival, and plasticity in the hippocampus.   In contrast, the BDNF Met protein has been shown to impair intracellular processing and activity-dependent modulation of BDNF in transfected hippocampal neuronal cultures.  Finally, the humanized BDNF mouse displays atypical estrous cycle-related variations in both anxiety-like behaviors (i.e., open field, elevated-plus maze) and object placement memory compared with wild type mice. Moreover, these ovarian steroid-regulated behaviors in the humanized mouse are accompanied by alterations in hippocampal plasticity, relevant to both our understanding of behavioral sensitivity to ovarian steroids and stress-related disorders. We focused on neural recruitment in the DLPFC and hippocampus. In addition to the well-established n-back activation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during WM, there is also a well-documented de-activation of the hippocampus observed in healthy controls at higher cognitive loads (possibly reflecting an uncoupling of hippocampal input to optimize prefrontal involvement in the increasing working memory load). For the PET analyses, 29 women were Val homozygotes and 10 were Met carriers; for the fMRI analysis there were 20 Val homozygotes and seven Met carriers. Participants were matched across genotypes for age, racial distribution, and handedness. Additionally, neither genotype nor hormone effects were observed in either depressive symptom ratings or working memory performance.In only Met carriers (i.e., women with the BDNF met allele in replace of the normal Val allele), the hippocampus was abnormally activated (not deactivated) during estradiol but not during the hypogonadal state or progesterone replacement. Separate analyses of the 0-back and 2-back indicate that these changes were due to neural activity during the working memory (2-back) condition and not the sensorimotor (0-back) control task. This study is the first in women to demonstrate a BDNF genotype by estradiol interaction on a cognitively-related neurophysiological response. These data suggest that the Met allele of the BDNF gene conveys an abnormal sensitivity to the presence of estradiol on hippocampal function, similar to that reported in the Met knock-in mice compared with wild type mice. In a second study, we employed similar methods to examine the impact of the COMT Val158Met genotype on PET measured rCBF in the PFC. COMT plays an important role in the regulation of intra-synaptic dopamine levels in the PFC and also has a high affinity for the hydroxylated metabolites of estradiol/estrone (i.e., catecholestrogens).  Moreover, the activity of COMT is reported to be both sexually dimorphic and modulated by estradiol (possibly by a putative ERE on the COMT gene in some human tissues). Consistent with a recent meta-analysis, whole-brain voxel-wise analysis revealed a significant COMT genotype by hormone interaction in the DLPFC, a finding that reflected estradiol-related changes in both Val and Met homozygotes.  Specifically, the Met homozygotes (n = 11) showed an increase in DLPFC activation during estradiol compared with hypogonadism, whereas Val homozygotes (n = 11) showed the opposite pattern with lower activation during estradiol.  DLPFC activation in heterozygotes (n = 13) was intermediate between the two homozygous groups.  Significant effects of genotype were observed only during estradiol conditions, with Met homozygotes having significantly increased DLPFC activation compared with Val homozygotes (p=.02).     These data are consistent with observations that both COMT genotype and the presence or absence of estradiol influence dopaminergic function in the PFC.  The mechanisms underlying this observation remain to be defined but are consistent with estradiol impacting PFC dopamine tuning through effects on DA synthesis and/or COMT enzyme activity, with attendant alterations in DLPFC efficiency.Overall, the findings from these studies demonstrate that in healthy women, variations in genes relevant to ovarian steroids can impact functional neurocircuitry in regionally- and hormonally-specific ways  here, specifically, interactions between BDNF and COMT genotypes and estradiol on the activation of functional neurocircuitry in the hippocampus (where BDNF is highly expressed) and the DLPFC (where COMT has primacy for dopamine trafficking), respectively.  In studies currently underway, we will examine these gene-hormone interactions in women with PMDD during working memory, as well, reward-responsive and resting state neural circuits will also be explored. Additionally, we are pursuing the effects of BDNF genotype on hippocampal function by employing a spatial navigation task and fMRI imaging.  We predict that the less functionally active Met allele will alter the impact of estradiol on activation within the hippocampus during this spatial navigation task. In collaboration with Dr. Bruce McEwen at the Rockefeller University (supported by an NIH Bench to Bedside award), we examine the effects of ovariectomy and estradiol replacement on both behavior and hippocampal gene expression in the female humanized BDNF Met knock-in mouse. Preliminary data from these translational studies suggest that Met knock-in mice show a differential behavioral sensitivity to estradiol in several hippocampal tasks and in anxiety-like behaviors. Results of hippocampal whole transcriptome gene expression studies are pending. Finally, together, these data emphasize that failure to consider gene-hormone interactions may lead to spurious conclusions about main effects of either variable.","Acute;Affect;Affective;Affinity;Age;Agonist;Alleles;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;anxiety-like behavior;Award;Back;BDNF gene;Behavior;Behavioral;behavioral response;bench to bedside;Binding;Brain;Brain region;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Catechol Estrogens;Cerebrovascular Circulation;cingulate cortex;Clinical Protocols;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive load;cognitive testing;Collaborations;COMT gene;Data;depressive symptoms;Dopamine;enzyme activity;Estradiol;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogens;Estrone;Estrous Cycle;Failure;Female;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;functional MRI scan;Gene Expression;Generations;Genes;Genetic Polymorphism;genomic variation;Genotype;Goals;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Gonadotropin Hormone Releasing Hormone;Handedness;Heterozygote;Hippocampus (Brain);Homozygote;Hormonal;hormone sensitivity;Hormones;Human;human tissue;humanized mouse;Hypogonadism;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis;Image;Impairment;Individual;Insula of Reil;Knock-in Mouse;Lead;Measurement;Measures;Medial;Memory;Meta-Analysis;Methods;Molecular;Mood Disorders;Mus;neural circuit;neural growth;neural recruitment;neuroimaging;Neurons;neurophysiology;Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2;Ovarian;Ovarian hormone;Ovariectomy;Oxygen;Participant;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Performance;performance tests;phenomenological models;Play;Positron-Emission Tomography;Postmenopause;preclinical study;Prefrontal Cortex;Premenopause;premenstrual dysphoric disorder;Procedures;Progesterone;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Regulation;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;response;Response Elements;Rest;reward processing;Rewards;Role;serotonin transporter;Sex Characteristics;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Site;social;Steroid Receptors;Steroids;Stress;stress related disorder;Synapses;System;Techniques;Testing;trafficking;transcriptome;translational study;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Variant;Water;way finding;Wild Type Mouse;Wisconsin;Withdrawal;Woman;Work;","THE NEUROREGULATORY EFFECTS OF GONADAL STEROIDS IN HUMANS",n/a,"NIMH","9568265","","",1ZIAMH002874-11,1,ZIA,MH,002874,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416711","SCHMIDT, PETER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,578224,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Contraception/Reproduction;Estrogen;Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","This report includes work arising from the following clinical protocol: NCT01434368.	We have recruited approximately half of the proposed sample, and several of the children in the original 12-13 year-old cohort have completed the study through to their 18th birthday. To date we have studied 44 prepubertal children (27 boys and 17 girls), who are clearly identified as pre-gonadarchal by Tanner staging and bone age. These children also have plasma levels of estradiol and testosterone at the lower limits of detectability, and have a bimodal distribution of plasma adrenal androgen levels (e.g., DHEA-S, androstenedione) indicating both boys and girls are in either early or later stages of adrenarche. Preliminary neuroimaging findings point to sex-differences particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in task-based paradigms, suggesting the presence of sex-differences prior to HPG axis (re)activation. Additionally, a connectome-wide association study (CWAS) in this prepubertal cohort identified sex-differences in resting state functional connectivity in the mPFC, a key region in the default-mode network (DMN). Using this mPFC region as a seed, post hoc analysis showed several clusters in the DMN and executive control network in which girls showed higher mPFC connectivity compared to boys, whereas no voxels showed higher connectivity in boys. These preliminary results suggest that there may be neural circuits that exhibit sex-differences prior to gonadarche and HPG axis activation. However, further analysis is needed to determine the factors contributing to sex-differences in this cohort. For example, in addition to possible independent sex-chromosomal effects, sex-differences could reflect greater exposures to adrenal androgens in those children who are in the later stages of adrenarche (which we can examine given the dichotomous distribution of adrenal androgen levels in this sample), or earlier sex steroid exposure secondary to the initial post-natal activation of the HPG axis which lasts 1-2 weeks in boys but up to two years in girls. 	Initial findings in our combined pre- and post-pubertal cohorts have identified several landmarks in reproductive aging that could have important implications for brain development. We have observed that post-menarcheal girls experience the commencement of fluctuations in estradiol secretion (presumably corresponding to the maturation of the normal architecture of the menstrual cycle). Given our findings of the importance of changes in ovarian steroid levels in RERMDs, these observations could signal an important physiologic event during which functional neurocircuitry undergoes reprogramming. We also have observed in both boys and girls that MRI-measured gonadal volumes increase across the pubertal transition. The individual inflection points in these volume curves identify another important reproductive event (i.e., the expansion of the gonad) that is a sentinel event indicating the initial activation of the GnRH pulse generator, gonadotropin secretion, and the beginning of gonadarche. As enrollment continues and our pre-pubertal children mature, the longitudinal analysis of the development of these sex-differences in brain activity (as well as developmental trajectories in brain that are not sexually dimorphic) could identify specific puberty-related reproductive or metabolic events relevant to normal brain development. These data also will serve as an important archival data set for studies of children at high risk for the development of behavioral disorders.  	In our larger cohort, preliminary results of multi-modal neuroimaging studies suggest that pubertal stage contributes to several measures of adolescent brain development and accounts for differences between adolescent and adult brain development that are both brain region- and sex-specific. First, , cognition-activated fMRI studies document differential working memory-related prefrontal-hippocampal functional connectivity in children (early puberty) and adolescents (late puberty). We found differential negative prefrontal-hippocampal functional coupling during working memory in children but not adolescents, which could indicate altered reciprocal coupling between an immature prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, along with changes in the level of cooperativity between these brain regions accompanying prefrontal cortical development during adolescence. Second, in our investigations of the development of neural inhibition in which we use fMRI and the well-validated Stop Signal Task (a reliable metric of neural inhibition), in which a pre-potent go response must be inhibited, we have been unable to confirm previous reports of significant sex- or age-related differences in the brain that support this key cognitive function. We did demonstrate a main effect of task, consistent with the current literature in both adults and children, with activation in the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally, the supplementary motor area, and the subthalamic nucleus. However, there were no significant effects of sex or pubertal status in these task-related brain regions, despite both sex and pubertal differences between behavioral measures, such as speed of go response and stop accuracy. We did observe a pubertal status-by-sex interaction in the right medial prefrontal cortex (BA10). Post-hoc testing showed there was a significant between-sex difference in the pre-pubertal cohort. This puberty group by sex interaction was found in the default mode network in a region where activity is reduced during non-referential goal related tasks; activation of this region also has shown to be related to social and emotional processes. Although preliminary, the sex difference in mPFC activation in the pre-pubertal children did not appear to be reflective of (or mediated by) differences in adrenal steroid levels either. Nonetheless, it may be possible that either adrenal steroid levels or organizational sex-differences in mPFC that emerge early in childhood are systematically altered during puberty. Indeed, we found that serum testosterone levels negatively correlated with mPFC activation in boys, possibly suggesting that when testosterone levels rise during puberty, they act to decrease mPFC activation, at least within the context of behavioral inhibition. Further investigation is needed to explore the correlates of the robust deactivation in pre-pubertal females. Finally, albeit preliminary, our findings in studies of emotional face-processing suggest that sex differences in socioemotional processing also are established prior to puberty and develop independent of gonadal sex-steroid secretion.","13 year old;8 year old;Adolescence;Adolescent;adolescent brain development;Adrenal Glands;Adult;Age;age related;Androgens;Androstenedione;Appearance;Architecture;Area;base;Behavior assessment;Behavior Disorders;behavior measurement;Behavioral inhibition;Bilateral;Biological Assay;Body Composition;bone age;boys;Brain;Brain region;Cells;Child;Childhood;Classification;Clinical;Clinical Protocols;Cognition;Cognitive;cognitive function;cohort;connectome;Coupling;Data;data archive;Data Set;dehydroepiandrosterone;Development;developmental neurobiology;Disease;Emotional;Endocrine;Endocrine system;Enrollment;epidemiology study;Estradiol;Event;executive function;Exhibits;experience;Exposure to;Face Processing;Fat Body;Female;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Genetic Variation;girls;GNRH1 gene;Goals;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Gonadal structure;Gonadotropins;Growth;Height;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;high risk;Hippocampus (Brain);Hormonal;Hormones;Human;hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis;In Vitro;indexing;Individual;Inferior frontal gyrus;Investigation;Laboratories;Life;Link;Literature;longitudinal analysis;Longitudinal Studies;lymphoblastoid cell line;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Medial;Mediating;Menstrual cycle;Mental Depression;Metabolic;Modality;Monitor;Motor;multimodality;neural circuit;Neural Inhibition;Neurobiology;neurodevelopment;neuroimaging;Neurons;neuropsychiatric disorder;Neurosciences;Neurosciences Research;Outcome Measure;Ovarian;Pattern;Physiologic pulse;Physiological;Plasma;Prefrontal Cortex;prepuberty;Prevalence;Process;Production;Puberty;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Reporting;reproductive;reproductive senescence;response;Rest;Role;Sampling;Secondary to;Seeds;Seminal;Sentinel;Serum;sex;Sex Characteristics;sexual dimorphism;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;social;Speed;Staging;Steroids;Structure;Structure of subthalamic nucleus;Substance abuse problem;System;tandem mass spectrometry;Techniques;Testing;Testosterone;Variant;Visceral;Weight;Work;","ENDOCRINE AND NEUROBIOLOGIC EVENTS ACCOMPANYING PUBERTY",n/a,"NIMH","9568278","","",1ZIAMH002933-06,1,ZIA,MH,002933,06,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416711","SCHMIDT, PETER ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,578224,
"Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Mental Health;Neurosciences","The goal of this research is to develop advanced magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging techniques and to apply them and other complementary methods to studying brain metabolism, neurotransmission and enzyme activity. MRS allows measurement of the neurotransmission of glutamate and GABA in vivo, which plays important roles in many major psychiatric diseases, including depression and schizophrenia. During 2016-2017, we made significant progress in the development and application of novel spectroscopic and imaging techniques for studying metabolism and neurotransmission in vivo in the brain. We invented and validated a computational method for quantifying spatially localized MRS data involving multiple nuclear spin systems (Zhang et al, Med. Phys., 2017, doi: 10.1002/mp.12375). This method can reduce the time for calculating chemical basis function, using a typical desktop personal computer, from days and weeks to just a few minutes. As such, design and optimization of proton MRS by computers have become practical and highly useful. By optimizing localized proton MRS using extensive computation to simultaneously maximize spectral resolution and sensitivity to nuclear spin relaxation we have developed a novel multiparametric technique that can simultaneously measure concentration, longitudinal and transverse relaxation times of many brain chemicals, including glutamate, in a single scan session within ten minutes of MRS data acquisition. This multiparametric approach allows us to measure both concentrations and the microenvironments of brain chemicals (e.g., glutamatergic neurons) in a typical clinical setting (An et al, Magn Reson Med. 2017. doi: 10.1002/mrm.26612.). In addition, a novel radiofrequency pulse-driven steady state method has been developed that can measure transverse relaxation of chemicals without the need to change echo times. Significant progress has also been made in studying glutamate and GABA neurotransmission and in vivo enzyme activities in both human and animal experiments. In particular, we demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of measuring carbonic anhydrase activity in the human subjects.","Address;Animal Experiments;Brain;Brain Diseases;brain metabolism;Carbon;carbonate dehydratase;cell type;Cerebral cortex;Chemicals;Choline;Clinical;Computers;Computing Methodologies;Creatine;Data;data acquisition;design;Development;enzyme activity;Enzymes;Functional disorder;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Glutamates;Glutathione;Goals;Human;human subject;imaging study;Imaging Techniques;in vivo;in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy;Label;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Measurement;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;metabolic abnormality assessment;Methods;myoinositol;neurochemistry;Neurons;neurotransmission;Neurotransmitters;novel;Nuclear;Personal Computers;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphocreatine;Physiologic pulse;Play;Protocols documentation;Protons;radiofrequency;Relaxation;Research;Resolution;Role;Scanning;Schizophrenia;spectroscopic imaging;Synapses;System;Techniques;Time;","MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY AND IMAGING STUDIES OF BRAIN FUNCTIONS",n/a,"NIMH","9568258","","",1ZIAMH002803-15,1,ZIA,MH,002803,15,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416741","SHEN, JUN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1474431,
"Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Mental Health;Neurosciences","As a noninvasive method for measuring the concentration and distribution of chemicals in the living brain, MRS is an important tool for studying brain function and disorders. However, acquiring robust measurement of MRS signals requires a sophisticated study design and the successful implementation and maintenance of various MRS techniques. An active area for research area, MRS technology attracts major efforts from top research centers around the world. Clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanners that are optimized for performing structural and functional imaging studies also present daunting obstacles for MRS technical development. Most of the MRS protocols at NIH have been developed and implemented by the MRS Core under protocols 05-M-0144 (NCT00109174) and 11-M-0045 (NCT01266577). 1) Correction of baseline in short echo time proton MRS. Data acquisition at short echo time is needed to capture the entire metabolic profile of brain visible to proton MRS and to acquire, at the same time, the broad macromolecule baseline. The macromolecule baseline contributes to Cremer Rao Lower Bound of the metabolite signals. To accurately quantify this effect accurately in clinical short echo time MRS, we recently developed and optimized a method, based on mean squared error of the baseline, for determining the smoothness of baseline. This advance has led to a more objective and reliable determination of metabolite signals (Zhang et al., Magn Reson Med, 72(4):913-22. 2014 ). 2) Automatic correction of magnetic field inhomogeneity. It is essential to optimize the homogeneity of the magnetic field for all MRS experiments, because field inhomogeneity can easily destroy the critical separation of different chemicals. More importantly, an inhomogeneous field makes it difficult to effective suppress the tissue water signal effectively, making the reliable detection of more dilute chemicals impossible. This is particularly the case for anatomical regions of interest to psychiatric research. We optimized an automatic shimming method that consistently out-performs the automatic shimming methods provided by MRI scanner manufacturers. This new method has already greatly improved the quality of clinical MRS data acquired at NIH. 3) Multi-slice chemical shift imaging of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine, and choline. The MRS core maintains a chemical shift imaging technique for mapping distribution of the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate at 3 Tesla. This method simultaneously generates images of N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and choline-containing compounds. 4) Glutathione detection. Glutathione is a marker for oxidative stress. Many psychiatric and neurological disorders (such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke) are associated with abnormal glutathione levels. In collaboration with Steven Warach (NINDS) a glutathione editing method was developed on the Philip 3 Tesla scanner at the Suburban Hospital for studying stroke patients using adaptive line-fitting. We have also developed a single-shot method for measuring glutathione at 7 Tesla (Lally et al, J Magn Reson Imaging. 2016, 43(1):88-98.).5) Carbon-13 MRS. Using carbon-13 labeled glucose or the glial-specific substrate acetate, it is possible to measure brain energetics and glutamate and glutamine cycling flux. Previously we invented a method for carbon-13 MRS by combining low power stochastic decoupling and intravenous infusion of glucose with a carbon-13 label at the C2 position. This strategy makes it possible to perform viable carbon-13 MRS on single channel clinicial MRI scanners. Using this strategy, we have acquired high quality carbon-13 MRS data from both the occipital and frontal lobes of healthy subjects and showed that it is possible to simultaneously detect two labeling pathways in the human brain. Recently, we have succeeded in implementing and optimizing this strategy on the 7 Tesla scanner with enhanced sensitivity and spectral resolution (Li et al, Magn Reson Med. 2016, 75(3):954-61), and we were the first to detect GABA turnover in the human brain.6) Proton glutamate editing. Previously we implemented a single-voxel glutamate editing method with correction of eddy current effects for measuring glutamate concentration at 3 Tesla. A method for simultaneously extracting both glutamate and glutamine from multi-echo MRS data has also been developed and implemented (Zhang et al, Magn Reson Med. 2016, 76(3):725-32). Recently, We developed and optimized a new glutamate editing method that needs a single echo time to isolate the glutamate H4 signal at 7 Tesla. 7) GABA editing. Previously we implemented and refined a method for measuring GABA. As with N-acetylaspartate imaging, patient movements can lead to difficulty in the accurate determination of GABA. We used a navigator strategy, based on residual water, to track and correct for patient movement. We also developed spectral data processing software to correct for phase changes because of patient motion (van der Veen et al, NMR Biomed. 2017. doi: 10.1002/nbm.3725.). Improvements to these  corrections have now been quantified and successfully applied in studies of human subjects. Currently, we are quantifying glutamate concentration using GABA-edited spectral data. The goal of this effort is to measure GABA and glutamate simultaneously.8) NAAG editing. We successfully developed MRS methods for measuring the dipeptide neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), which plays an important role in glutamate signaling. Our methods use regularized line-shape deconvolution, based on the L-curve method and Wiener filtering, to measure NAAG reliably (An et al, Magn Reson Med. 2014, 72(4):903-12). 9) 7 Tesla Phosphorus MRS imaging. We have developed a chemical shift imaging method for measuring phosphorus-containing chemicals in brain. The method has been successfully tested in occipital lobe. Development and testing for frontal lobe studies are currently in progress.","Acetates;Alzheimer's Disease;Anatomy;Area;base;Basic Science;Biochemical;Biopsy;Brain;Carbon;Chemical Shift Imaging;Chemicals;Choline;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Sciences;Collaborations;Computer software;computerized data processing;Core Facility;Creatine;Data;data acquisition;Data Analyses;Data Quality;Detection;Development;Dipeptides;Disease;Ensure;experimental study;frontal lobe;Functional Imaging;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;Glucose;glutamatergic signaling;Glutamates;Glutamine;Glutathione;Goals;Hospitals;Human;human subject;Image;imaging modality;imaging study;Imaging Techniques;improved;interest;Intravenous infusion procedures;Label;Lead;macromolecule;magnetic field;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Maintenance;Manufacturer Name;Measurement;Measures;Mental disorders;metabolic profile;Methods;Motion;Movement;N-acetylaspartate;N-acetylaspartylglutamate;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;nervous system disorder;neurochemistry;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Occipital lobe;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Patients;phase change;Phosphorus;Play;Positioning Attribute;Protocols documentation;Protons;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Residual state;Resolution;Role;Schizophrenia;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Slice;spectroscopic imaging;Stroke;suburb;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;tool;United States National Institutes of Health;Water;","MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY CORE FACILITY",n/a,"NIMH","9568289","","",1ZICMH002894-11,1,ZIC,MH,002894,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416741","SHEN, JUN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,893277,

"Anxiety Disorders;Autoimmune Disease;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities;Eating Disorders;Infectious Diseases;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative;Prevention;Serious Mental Illness","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) affects 1-2% of children and adolescents, causing significant distress and impairments from the unrelenting obsessional thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Approximately 1/4 of children with OCD report an abrupt, dramatic onset of their symptoms.  When these symptoms are accompanied by other behavior problems, cognitive changes and somatic symptoms, the child may qualify for a diagnosis of Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS). PANS is characterized by the sudden onset of OCD and/or eating disorder, accompanied by at least two of the following seven comorbidities: 1) Anxiety; 2) Emotional lability and/or depression; 3) Irritability, aggression and/or severely oppositional behaviors; 4) Behavioral (developmental) regression; 5) Deterioration in school performance; 6) Sensory or motor abnormalities; 7) Somatic signs and symptoms, including sleep disturbances, enuresis or urinary frequency and others. For a full description, see: Chang K et al.  Clinical evaluation of youth with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): Recommendations from the 2013 PANS Consensus Conference.         J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacology 2015. 25(1): p 3-13.The clinical description of PANS arose from investigations of a group of children with acute-onset OCD whose symptoms appeared to arise as a consequence of common childhood infections, including Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections ('strep throat' and Scarlet fever). Children whose symptoms begin or exacerbate following GAS infections may belong to a subgroup of neuropsychiatric disorders identified by the acronym PANDAS (for Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). The postulated etiology for the PANDAS subgroup is that specific strains of Group A streptococci (GAS), in genetically susceptible individuals, elicit the production of cross-reactive antibodies which recognize antigens not only on the GAS cell wall, but also in the host brain tissue, eliciting obsessions, compulsions, tics and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. The cross-reactive antibodies have been shown to correlate with other anti-streptococcal antibodies and also with neuropsychiatric symptom severity, with highest titers seen in children acutely ill with Sydenham chorea or PANDAS symptomatology. Research at NIH and elsewhere has revealed that: the PANDAS subgroup has a specific and identifiable symptom course (marked most notably by the acute, abrupt, overnight onset of symptoms ('zero to sixty in less than 24 hours'); the cross-reactive antibodies correlate with both GAS infection status and neuropsychiatric symptom severity; passive transfer of the cross-reactive antibodies replicated disease symptoms in animal models; prevention of GAS infections through antibiotic prophylaxis results in prevention of neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations; and, treatment of acutely ill children with immunomodulatory therapies specifically, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis, may produce dramatic reductions in symptom severity. This line of research is unusual, in that it reverses the typical 'bench to bedside' progression and takes clinical observations into the laboratory in search of information about etiopathogenic mechanisms. This approach is yielding exciting results, as serum samples from acutely ill children contain cross-reactive antibodies which target brain antigens, presumably triggering the clinical manifestations.  Identification of the antigenic targets may provide new targets for therapeutic interventions. Dr. Swedo, Dr. James Leckman and colleagues at the Yale University Child Study Center, and Dr. Madeleine Cunningham of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center were the joint recipients of an NIH 'Bench to Bedside' award which helped fund a multi-site placebo-controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for severely ill children with PANDAS (Protocol 11-M-0058, NCT 01281969). More than 40 children (3-12 years old) enrolled in the trial and 35 were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of IVIG or placebo. Although there were no significant differences between the IVIG and placebo groups, open-label treatment with IVIG produced improvements in over 80% of the children. (Williams et al, JAACAP 2016)  Data and samples from the study are being used in attempts to identify predictors of treatment response, as well as biomarkers of disease severity. Dr. Swedo is currently leading efforts to create a nationwide collaborative PANS/PANDAS clinical research network with the goals of (1) improving recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of acute onset neuropsychiatric syndromes, (2) conducting research which improves understanding of etiologic factors, host vulnerability, and disease mechanisms, and c) increasing awareness and recognition of PANDAS, PANS, and related disorders in order to improve access to care.  The inaugural meeting of the Network was held early in 2016, with 14 academic institutions represented.  In addition to agreeing on common measures for diagnostic assessment, the attendees agreed to develop guidelines for treatment of PANS/PANDAS.  The guidelines are being published by the Journal of Child & Adolescent Psychopharmacology as a set of four papers which provide a comprehensive approach to clinical management (Swedo et al) and include recommendations for use of psychiatric medications and cognitive-behavior therapy (Thienemann et al), as well as treatment with antibiotics (Cooperstock et al) and immunomodulatry therapies (Frankovich et al)(J Child Adol Psychopharmacology Sep 2017, Vol 7, Issue 7, pages 562-606)","12 year old;acronyms;Acute;Adolescent;Affect;Aggressive behavior;Animal Model;Antibiotic Prophylaxis;Antibiotics;Antibodies;Antigens;Anxiety;Attention;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmune Process;Award;Awareness;Behavior;Behavioral;bench to bedside;Biological Markers;Brain;brain research;brain tissue;Cell Wall;Child;Childhood;Clinical;clinical diagnostics;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;Cognitive;cognitive change;Cognitive Therapy;Comorbidity;compulsion;Compulsive Behavior;Consensus;cross reactivity;Data;design;Deterioration;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Distress;Eating Disorders;effective therapy;Emotional;Enrollment;Enuresis;Etiology;Evaluation;Funding;Goals;Guidelines;Health Sciences;Health Services Accessibility;Hour;immunoregulation;Impairment;Improve Access;improved;Increased frequency of micturition;Individual;Infection;Institution;Intravenous Immunoglobulins;Intravenous infusion procedures;Investigation;Joints;Journals;Knowledge;Laboratories;Measures;meetings;Mental Depression;micturition urgency;Motor;National Institute of Mental Health;neuropsychiatric disorder;neuropsychiatric symptom;neuropsychiatry;new therapeutic target;novel;Obsession;Obsessive compulsive behavior;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Oklahoma;open label;Paper;Performance;Personality;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharyngeal structure;placebo controlled study;Placebos;Plasmapheresis;predictive of treatment response;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Problem behavior;Production;Protocols documentation;Psychopharmacology;Publishing;Randomized;Recommendation;Reporting;Research;research clinical testing;Research Project Grants;Sampling;Sampling Studies;Scarlet Fever;Schools;Sensory;Separation Anxiety;Serum;Severities;Severity of illness;Signs and Symptoms;Site;Sleep disturbances;Streptococcal Infections;Streptococcus pyogenes;Subgroup;Sydenham Chorea;symposium;symptomatology;Symptoms;Syndrome;Therapeutic Intervention;Thinking;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Youth;","EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE AND RELATED DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9589752","","",1ZIAMH002666-25,1,ZIA,MH,002666,25,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9694571","SWEDO, SUSAN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1008141,
"Autism;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD);Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","Autism spectrum disorder is currently defined as a single neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. However, there is mounting evidence that autism spectrum disorder represents a collection of overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders, resulting from a variety of neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, neuroimmunologic and/or genetic abnormalities. This research program aims to characterize the behavioral and biological manifestations of these differing presentations of ASD and to identify their unique features in order to facilitate development of effective therapeutic and preventive interventions. During the reporting period, this project analyzed data from a longitudinal, phenotyping investigation of 106 young children (ages 1-6 years) with autism, 60 age and sex-matched typically developing controls and a group of 25 children with non-autistic developmental delays (Protocol NCT 00298246). The focus of analyses now is on the longitudinal data. Analyses included comprehensive medical and developmental histories; neuropsychological, medical and neurological evaluations; assays of blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples; and also a variety of specialized studies, including routine and overnight electroencephalograms (EEGs); modified polysomnography to evaluate sleep architecture; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans); genetic assays; and dysmorphology evaluations. Analyses of behavioral data included a recent investigation of specific nonverbal communicative behaviors, finding gesture use under the age of 4 in this sample predicted receptive language outcomes. We recently explored CSF and blood samples in this cohort, both with respect to concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, for the presence of cerebral folate deficiency, and also with respect to abnormal cytokine or chemokine levels, for the presence of immune abnormalities. Neither of these explorations yielded results that indicated consistent abnormalities of these types were apparent in this sample. With respect to cytokines and chemokines, some modulators of immune function (e.g., EGF and soluble CD40 ligand) were increased in the autism group; however, no evidence of group differences in traditional markers of active inflammation (e.g., IL-6, TNF, IL-1) were observed in the serum. Further, within-subject stability (measured by estimated intraclass correlations) of most analytes was low, indicating that a single measurement is not a reliable prospective indicator of concentration for most analytes. Additionally, in participants with autism, there was little correspondence between the blood and CSF profiles of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, suggesting that peripheral markers may not optimally reflect the immune status of the central nervous system.We also analyzed data from MRI scans, which found signals of abnormal myelination in specific brain areas (i.e. corpus callosum) in children with autism, as well as other indicators of abnormalities in brain white matter and a relative thinner cortex in specific key regions in the brain. Evidence of previously reported abnormalities of early brain growth was also investigated, both through imaging as well as head circumference records, with data indicating previous findings may have spuriously overestimated increased head size in autism due to inadequate norms. Longitudinal data found a lack of typical age-related cortical thickness decreases in children with autism, and increases in cortical thickness in some areas were actually associated with language gains. As expected, genetic abnormalities were found in approximately 10% of the subjects and the aberrations are being evaluated for clinical significance. Further, whole exome sequencing of the cohort is currently under analysis, including the relationship of sequencing data and phenotypic variations. Other phenotyping studies have been recently completed. Each of them shares the goal of providing a deeper understanding of the autism phenotype and its relationship to etiology, clinical course and outcome. One of these projects is a prospective, longitudinal investigation of toddlers considered to be at-risk for ASD because of the presence of early language delays (Protocol NCT01339767). This study aimed to delineate early communicative impairments that predict ASD and to distinguish these from non-specific markers of (non-autistic) developmental delays.  Data collection has now been completed, and analyses will also examine the relationship of communication impairments to abnormalities of brain structure and function assessed by electroencephalograms (EEGs), structural MRIs, and functional MRI scans, with the goal of identifying specific risk and resilience factors for ASD.   This study included a pilot of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), with findings indicating lower cognitive (including language) abilities in toddlers were associated with fNIRS measures of both lower oxygenation variability and more extreme lateralization index values (which indicate differences in oxy-hemoglobin saturation from left and right prefrontal cortex). We also finished data collection for a NIRS study of children aged 4 to 8 years of age during this time period. The goal here was to pilot this relatively new form of functional neuroimaging in children who are too young or behaviorally-challenged to tolerate functional MRI scanning procedures -- a key group that is missing from much of the neuroimaging literature on autism. Using executive functioning tasks, this study obtained reliable and informative brain activation data on children with autism as young as 4 years old as well as typically developing controls. In addition to finding developmentally sensitive parameters of cerebral autoregulation, we also analyzed prefrontal activation in typically developing children during two executive functioning tasks and found that the strength of activation increased with age and with improvements in task performance. A second NIH Bench-to-Bedside award is now being used to investigate typically developing and at risk infants, to explore use of a combined fNIRS and EEG system (see: http://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/ccc/btb/awards1.html Mirror neuron network dysfunction as an early biomarker of neurodevelopment).","4 year old;8 year old;Affect;Age;age related;aged;Area;Attention;autism spectrum disorder;Autistic Disorder;Award;Behavior;Behavioral;bench to bedside;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Blood specimen;Brain;brain abnormalities;CD40 Ligand;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Cerebrum;chemokine;Child;Clinical;clinically significant;Cognitive;cohort;Collection;Communication impairment;Corpus Callosum;cytokine;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Development;Developmental Delay Disorders;Diagnostic;disability;Disease;Dysmorphology;EGF gene;Electroencephalogram;Etiology;Evaluation;executive function;exome sequencing;Folic Acid Deficiency;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;functional MRI scan;Gestures;Goals;Growth;Growth Factor;Head;Head circumference;Health Care Costs;Homeostasis;Image;imaging genetics;Immune;immune function;immunological status;Impairment;indexing;Individual;Infant;Inflammation;interest;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-6;Investigation;Investments;Language;Language Delays;Left;Literature;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Medical;mirror neuron;Molecular Abnormality;myelination;Near-Infrared Spectroscopy;network dysfunction;Neuraxis;neurodevelopment;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;neuroimaging;Neurologic;neurophysiology;Neuropsychology;Outcome;outcome forecast;Oxyhemoglobin;Participant;Peripheral;Phenotype;Polysomnography;Prefrontal Cortex;Preventive Intervention;Procedures;programs;prospective;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Recording of previous events;Records;repetitive behavior;Reporting;Research;resilience;Risk;Sampling;Serum;sex;Signal Transduction;Sleep Architecture;social communication;Structure;Subgroup;Support System;Symptoms;System;Task Performances;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Time;TNF gene;Toddler;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;United States National Institutes of Health;Urine;Variant;white matter;","CLINICAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPING OF AUTISM AND RELATED DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9569196","","",1ZIAMH002868-12,1,ZIA,MH,002868,12,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9694571","SWEDO, SUSAN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1008141,

All of this data is archived, but it is not currently standardized, organized, or consented such that investigators can aggregate across the participants in the many ongoing studies within the NIH IRP. The DSST is working to change that on three fronts. First, we have consulted with the scientists responsible for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project who have established standard MRI protocols to use on large, diverse groups of participants across different scanner platforms. The protocols are now available on the FMRIF scanners and will soon replace the clinical scans currently collected on all participants on a yearly basis. Second, we have deployed a data sharing repository using the software developed at the Stanford Center  for Reproducible Neuroscience. This repository went online in June of 2017 and is currently accessible to intramural researchers on the NIH campus. It will be available to researchers throughout the world before the end of the year. Third, we have worked closely with the NIMH Office of the Clinical Director to help develop a protocol for recruiting and scanning healthy volunteers. This protocol will provide a pool of volunteers that can be streamlined into other studies within the IRP while also building a normative database of phenotypic, genetic, and imaging data.Facilitating Access to Shared DataThe DSST is also working to facilitate and streamline access to existing public data repository for NIMH intramural researchers by creating a local copy on the NIH High Performance Computing System, also known as the Biowulf. Once the local copy is in place, the DSST guides researchers through the necessary data use agreements and then grants them access to the data. This has already been accomplished for the Human Connectome Project which offers comprehensive phenotypic, genetic and imaging data on 1200 participants. We are in the process of making data available from the LIFE Project (2,377 participants), the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)  project (10,000 participants), the Child Mind Institute's Healthy Brain Network, and the UK Biobank (100,000 participants). Delivering Education and TrainingConducting reproducible science on large datasets requires skillsets that many researchers do not possess. Since May of 2016 the DSST has conducted four hands-on courses and hosted invited talks from internationally recognized experts in the field of open and reproducible science. All slides and materials are available at https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst - On May 26 & 27, 2016 the DSST taught a course on Data Carpentry in the NIH library. - On June 9 & 10 2016 the DSST taught a course on Software Carpentry for the NIH Graduate Partnership program. - On Nov 2, 2016  Adam Thomas gave a presentation on reproducible methods to the MEG North America Meeting.- On Dec 9, 2016 the DSST hosted Dr. Matthew Brett who provided an education lecture on how to improve reproducibility in neuroimaging research.- On Jan 25, 2017 John Lee taught in the Introduction to R: Data Wrangling & Statistical Analysis course at the NIH Library. - On March 13-17, 2017 the DSST held a four day course on reproducible neuroscience .- On April 25th, 2017 John Lee taught a course on using R for reproducible analyses in the NIH Library.- On May 18, 2017 the DSST held a workshop on reproducible research as part of the NIH Pi Day celebration.- On August 1-2, 2017 the DSST held a two-day course on reproducible neuroscience with guest lectures from Dr. Satra Ghosh of MIT and Dr. Yarik Halchenko of Dartmouth University.- On August 14th & 17th, 2017 the DSST hosted talks from Dr. Anisha Keshavan on Crowdsourcing in Neuroscience and Dr. Regina Nuzzo on common statistical pitfalls in neuroscience.Future Directions and Applications One of the motivations for building large, standardized repositories of data is so that we may more easily employ data-hungry techniques such as machine learning. The Data Science and Sharing Team was conceived of and designed to work closely with the Machine Learning Team which is still forming. In August of 2017, Charles Zheng, the first member of that team arrived and we are actively planning future projects. Two more members of that team are expected to arrive in the next few months.Nino Migineishvili, a summer student from UCLA who has been working with the DSST since June 2017, has also been applying machine learning to several large datasets: one acquired here by Dr. Philip Shaw from the Social and Behavioral Research Branch at NHGRI (442 participants) and others acquired outside NIH such as the Nathan Kline Institute (888 participants). Nino's project of predicting brain age from structural images has been pre-registered at Open Science Foundation and is currently being prepared for publication (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.25126.63047).Jong Hwan Lee, a visiting professor from Korea University working with the DSST and Dr. Peter Bandettini, has also been applying machine learning methods to predict fMRI time course using the HCP dataset on the NIH HPC. Several similar, data-intensive projects are planned for the coming year.","Adolescent;Age;Agreement;Alzheimer's Disease;Annual Reports;Archives;Behavioral Research;biobank;Brain;Child;Clinical;Code;cognitive development;Communities;Computer software;Computer Systems;connectome;Consent;Consult;crowdsourcing;Data;Data Science;Data Set;Data Storage and Retrieval;data wrangling;Databases;design;direct application;Education;Educational workshop;Foundations;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Genetic;Goals;Grant;healthy volunteer;High Performance Computing;Human;Image;improved;Institutes;International;Intramural Research Program;Korea;learning strategy;lectures;Libraries;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;meetings;member;Methods;Mind;Mission;Motivation;National Human Genome Research Institute;National Institute of Mental Health;neuroimaging;Neurosciences;North America;open data;Participant;Phenotype;Process;professor;programs;Protocols documentation;Publications;Recruitment Activity;repository;Reproducibility;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Scanning;Science;Scientist;sharing data;Slide;social;software development;Standardization;Statistical Data Interpretation;Students;Techniques;Time;tool;Training;Training and Education;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Visit;volunteer;Work;","DATA SCIENCE AND SHARING TEAM",n/a,"NIMH","9589768","","",1ZICMH002960-01,1,ZIC,MH,002960,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15265885","THOMAS, ADAM ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,548228,
"Autism;Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Genetics;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD);Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","This past year the Neurodevelopmental and Behavioral Phenotyping Service conducted over 200 neurodevelopmental assessments and focused on collection and analyses of data from a variety of rare genetic disorders associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Much of the data analyzed has been collected through a protocol that includes behavioral assessments (NCT00271622) and a collaborative protocol that includes assessment of specific rare genetic conditions (NCT02461420). We are investigators on these and several other multi-site studies that are conducting behavioral phenotyping of conditions that have yet to have their natural histories fully explored, including Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, Moebius Syndrome, propionic acidemia, creatine transport deficiency, holoprocencephaly, congenital disorders of glycosylation and other diagnosed and undiagnosed conditions that affect neurodevelopment early in life.  These characterization studies are necessary for beginning to understand the breadth and depth of syndromes that cause lifelong impairments, based on developmental delays that often lead to Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Related to these goals, we seek to take advantage of gains made in identification of genetic abnormalities in those already diagnosed with ASD or Intellectual Disability, by exploring whether genotypic differences may be reflected in behavioral phenotype differences in cohorts of children diagnosed with these conditions. As such, we engaged in collaborative efforts to analyze genotype-phenotype data from large scale ASD collections and identified phenotypic profiles of children with ASD identified with specific genetic abnormalities.  Such analyses allow us to refine our understanding of when and how symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders present if genetic etiologies such as 16p11.2 duplications or deletions are identified.We are specifically focused on the rates and types of Intellectual Disability and ASD profiles within rare genetic conditions, given the implications of these diagnoses on lifelong disability and the need for potential treatment targets and appropriate outcome measures. Our collection of data using standardized autism diagnostic instruments (e.g. the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and traditional measures of intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior allows us to conduct analyses on how use of these measures differs within specific genetic disorders, to gain an understanding of how ASD and neurocognitive profiles may present differently based on specific etiology.  Given that the field is moving towards such genetic first approaches, we also use our unique study populations to explore the limitations of our current measures and terminology for fully characterizing individuals who are minimally verbal or severely intellectually impaired.  This group of children are particularly important for inclusion in potential treatment trials of rare genetic conditions, but for which few tools have been developed with adequate representation in standardization samples. We also plan to use such data to improve upon existing measures, and collaborate with others to develop new tools. Our goal here is to participate in the creation of tools that capture the full range of social-communication development, including the ability to capture profiles of those with early onset of neurologic conditions.  We seek to create measures that capture growth and differences that may be important for recognizing change based on treatment as well as loss of skills that often accompanies both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.","16p11.2;Adaptive Behaviors;Affect;Assessment tool;autism spectrum disorder;Autistic Disorder;base;Behavior assessment;Behavioral;Biological Markers;Child;Clinical Research;Cognitive;cohort;Collection;Congenital Disorders;Creatine;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Development;Developmental Delay Disorders;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;disability;early onset;Etiology;Extramural Activities;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genotype;glycosylation;Goals;Growth;Hereditary Disease;Impairment;improved;Individual;instrument;Intellectual functioning disability;Interview;ketotic hyperglycinemia;Lead;Life;Measures;Mental disorders;Mission;Molecular Abnormality;National Institute of Mental Health;Natural History;Nerve Degeneration;Neurocognitive;neurodevelopment;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurologic;Outcome Measure;Phenotype;phenotypic data;programs;Protocols documentation;psychologic;Research Personnel;Sampling;Schedule;Services;Site;skills;social communication;Standardization;standardize measure;study population;Symptoms;Syndrome;Terminology;Testing;tool;treatment trial;United States National Institutes of Health;Williams Syndrome;","NEURODEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPING ",n/a,"NIMH","9568295","","",1ZICMH002961-01,1,ZIC,MH,002961,01,,Unavailable,"","","",,"15226869","THURM, AUDREY ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,407698,
"Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD);Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Neurosciences;Pediatric;Pediatric Research Initiative","A typical scene contains many different objects that compete for neural representation due to the limited processing capacity of the visual system. At the neural level, competition among multiple objects is evidenced by the mutual suppression of their visually evoked responses. The competition among multiple objects can be biased by both bottom-up sensory-driven mechanisms (exogenous attention), such as stimulus salience, and top-down, goal-directed influences, such as selective, endogenous attention. Although the competition among multiple objects for representation is ultimately resolved within visual cortex, the source of top-down biasing signals likely derives from a distributed network of areas in frontal and parietal cortex. Previous research has suggested that the right middle frontal gyrus (rMFG) may serve as a node of interaction between neural networks for top-down goal-directed endogenous attention and bottom-up, stimulus-driven exogenous attention. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the performance on an orientation discrimination task of a patient with a rMFG resection (to remove a brain tumor) and healthy controls. On endogenous attention trials, a valid central cue predicted with 90% accuracy the location of a peri-threshold Gabor patch. On the 10% invalid trials, the Gabor patch appeared in the opposite location to the cue. On exogenous attention trials, a cue appeared briefly at one of two peripheral locations, followed, after a variable inter-stimulus interval (ISI; range 0 to 700 ms), by a Gabor patch in either the same (valid) or opposite location (invalid). Analysis of behavioral data showed that for both patient and controls, valid cues facilitated faster reaction times compared to invalid cues, on endogenous and short ISI exogenous trials. However, at longer ISI exogenous trials, the patient was unable to withhold his responses, resulting in reduced performance compared to controls. This may be related to the patients inability to reorient attention in a top-down fashion after the effect of the exogenous cue has dissipated, and suggests a putative role of the rMFG in switching between exogenous and endogenous modes of attention. Analysis of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) showed that in the patient, relative to controls, two brain regions (right superior parietal lobule and right orbitofrontal cortex) that are normally connected to the resected area significantly increased their coupling with the areas homologue in the left hemisphere. Thus, in the absence of the right MFG, the left hemisphere homologue appears to have compensated (either during tumor growth or after resection) by increasing communication with other nodes of the visuospatial, decision-making and impulse control circuitry. We have also undertaken studies in healthy participants to explore the normalization model of attention, which proposes that attention can affect performance by contrast or response gain changes, depending on the stimulus size and the relative size of the attention field. Here, we manipulated the attention field by affective valence (positive versus negative faces), while the stimulus size was fixed in a spatial cueing task. Emotional faces served as a cue to attract spatial attention, followed by a pair of gratings. Subjects performed an orientation discrimination task on one of two gratings; for each of five contrasts (the contrasts of both gratings were identical on any given trial and co-varied across trials in random order). A response-cue at stimuli offset indicated the target location, yielding valid cues (the emotional face matched response-cue) and invalid cues (mismatched) conditions. Comparing performance accuracy (d') for valid and invalid trials revealed the spatial cueing effect for each contrast. The measured psychometric function for each affective valence (positive and negative) and each trial condition (valid and invalid) was fit with the standard Naka-Rushton equation. Two parameters d'max (asymptotic performance at high contrast levels) and c50 (the contrast yielding half maximum performance) determined response gain and contrast gain, respectively. We observed a change in the spatial cueing effect consonant with a change in contrast gain for positive faces and a change in response gain for negative faces. Significantly, individual differences in self-reported emotional strength of positive and negative faces correlated with contrast and response gain changes, respectively. A functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment confirmed that subjects attention fields were wider for positive faces than that for negative faces. Effective connectivity analysis showed that the emotional valence-dependent AF was closely associated with feedback from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to V1. Together, these findings suggest that emotional attention shapes perception by means of the normalization framework and that the DLPFC plays a crucial role in this process.Visuospatial attention often improves task performance by increasing signal gain at attended locations and decreasing noise at unattended locations. Attention is also believed to be the mechanism that allows information to enter awareness. In this experiment, we assessed whether orienting endogenous visuospatial attention with cues differentially affects visual discrimination sensitivity (an objective task performance) and visual awareness (the subjective feeling of perceiving) during the same discrimination task. Gabor patch targets were presented laterally, either at low contrast (contrast stimuli) or at high contrast embedded in noise (noise stimuli). Participants reported their orientation either in a 3-alternative choice task (clockwise, counterclockwise, unknown) that allowed for both objective and subjective reports, or in a 2-alternative choice task (clockwise, counterclockwise) that provided a control for objective reports. Signal detection theory models were fit to the experimental data: estimated perceptual sensitivity reflected objective performance; decision criteria, or subjective biases, were a proxy for visual awareness. Attention increased sensitivity (i.e., improved objective performance) for the contrast, but not for the noise stimuli. Indeed, with the latter, attention did not further enhance the already high target signal or reduce the already low uncertainty on its position. Interestingly, for both contrast and noise stimuli, attention resulted in more liberal criteria, i.e., awareness increased. The noise condition is thus an experimental configuration where people think they see the targets they attend to better, even if they do not. This could be explained by an internal representation of their attentional state, which influences awareness independent of objective visual signals.","Affect;Affective;Anatomy;Area;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Awareness;Behavioral;Behavioral Paradigm;Biological Neural Networks;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain Neoplasms;Brain region;Child;Communication;Coupling;Cues;Data;Decision Making;Diagnosis;Discrimination;Disease;Emotional;Equation;Excision;experimental study;Face;Feedback;Feeling;frontal lobe;functional disability;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Homologous Gene;Human;Hyperactive behavior;Impairment;improved;Impulsivity;inattention;Individual;Individual Differences;Left;Lobule;Location;Measures;Mediating;Middle frontal gyrus structure;Modeling;Monkeys;neurobehavioral disorder;neuromechanism;Noise;Parietal;Parietal Lobe;Participant;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Perception;Performance;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Population;Positioning Attribute;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevalence;Primates;Process;Protocols documentation;Proxy;Psychometrics;Public Health;Reaction Time;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;Resected;response;Rest;Role;School-Age Population;Sensory;Shapes;Signal Detection Analysis;Signal Transduction;Source;Stimulus;stimulus interval;System;Task Performances;Testing;tumor growth;Uncertainty;Visual;Visual attention;Visual Cortex;visual information;Visual system structure;Visuospatial;Work;","FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF PERCEPTUAL AND ATTENTIONAL SYSTEMS IN THE PRIMATE BRAIN",n/a,"NIMH","9568242","","",1ZIAMH002035-37,1,ZIA,MH,002035,37,,Unavailable,"","","",,"2065089","UNGERLEIDER, LESLIE G",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,594735,
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Clinical Research;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Lesions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex in humans can result in the syndrome termed prosopagnosia, an inability to recognize familiar faces. Single-cell recordings from IT cortex of monkeys have revealed the existence of neurons that are selectively activated by visual images of faces. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of both human and monkey brains has demonstrated face-selective regions, in which the fMRI signal evoked by faces is greater compared to that evoked by non-face objects. Together, these studies point to specialized neural machinery in the primate brain for processing faces. Thus far, our group and others have shown that the neural circuitry for face processing consists of a network of brain regions in the temporal and prefrontal cortex as well as in the amygdala.During the past year, we have made a number of important discoveries regarding the neural mechanisms mediating face processing:   1. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala led to stronger fMRI activation in face- than object-selective regions in the monkey temporal lobe, indicating that cortical face processing is strongly modulated by feedback from the amygdala, which likely conveys the emotion signaled by anothers expression and focuses the viewers attention on diagnostic facial features.   2. Multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI signals together with machine learning methods revealed that the classification of emotional facial expression and facial identity occurs in different neural substrates of the human brain: the amygdala and posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) for the former and the fusiform face area and anterior inferior temporal cortex for the latter.   3. Thetaburst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS), which temporarily disrupts neural activity, delivered over the posterior STS reduced the neural response to dynamic faces (but not to bodies or objects) in the posterior STS, anterior STS and amygdala, compared to TBS delivered over the vertex, indicating a cortico-amygdala pathway via the STS for dynamic face perception in humans.   4. Intranasal administration of oxytocin, a neuropeptide and potential treatment for autism, selectively altered fMRI responses to emotional expressions in monkeys, significantly reducing responses to both fearful and aggressive faces in face-responsive regions while leaving responses to appeasing and neutral faces unchanged, thereby explaining the beneficial effects of oxytocin on social cognition.   5. Pharmacological inactivation combined with fMRI in monkeys demonstrated that the functional network among the face-processing regions is hierarchically organized: activation of the amygdala by faces depends on inputs from the anterior temporal lobe face regions, whereas activation of these anterior regions depends on inputs from more posterior temporal lobe face regions.   6. Detection of configural face differences by humans led to stronger activation relative to featural face differences in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and transcranial magnetic stimulation centered on PPC impaired their performance on configural but not featural difference detections, indicating that spatial mechanisms within the PPC are necessary for configural face processing and, more broadly, for veridical face perception.   7. Patients with Moebius syndrome, a rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by facial paralysis, showed an impairment in their ability to recognize emotional expressions in others, indicating that the perception of emotional expressions depends on the ability to produce those expressions oneself.   8. The pattern of eye movements in monkeys reveals that, like humans, they experience face pareidolia, the experience of perceiving faces on inanimate objects, indicating that this illusion is driven by a broadly-tuned face detection mechanism that we share with other species.","Acute;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Anterior;Anxiety;Architecture;Attention;Autistic Disorder;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Cells;Chronic;Classification;Detection;Diagnostic;Disease;Electric Stimulation;Emotional;Emotions;experience;Eye Movements;Face;face perception;Face Processing;Facial Expression;Facial paralysis;Feedback;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;fusiform face area;Genetic;Goals;Human;Illusions;Image;Impairment;Inferior;Intranasal Administration;learning strategy;Lesion;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Mediating;microstimulation;Monkeys;nervous system disorder;neural circuit;Neurobiology;neuromechanism;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Oxytocin;Parietal Lobe;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Perception;Performance;Pharmacology;Prefrontal Cortex;Primates;Prosopagnosia;Protocols documentation;relating to nervous system;response;Schizophrenia;showing emotion;Signal Transduction;social cognition;Social Interaction;Structure of superior temporal sulcus;Syndrome;Techniques;Temporal Lobe;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Visual;Work;","FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF FACE PROCESSING IN THE PRIMATE BRAIN",n/a,"NIMH","9568275","","",1ZIAMH002918-09,1,ZIA,MH,002918,09,,Unavailable,"","","",,"2065089","UNGERLEIDER, LESLIE G",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,3171921,
"Bioengineering;Mental Health;Neurosciences","This is the first year of operation of the Systems Neuroscience Imaging Resource (SNIR). Much of the focus has been on equipment acquisition and procedure development.The first piece of equipment specifically purchased for the SNIR is a Zeiss AxioscanZ1 slide scanning microscope. This is a high quality widefield microscope with transmitted brightfield and fluorescent epi-illumination capacity. Its most significant feature is the ability to program multichannel tiled acquisition of large areas from up to 100 microscope slides. It is being actively used by investigators from 10 different intramural laboratories for projects that include whole brain mapping of gene expression profiles and the projections of genetically tagged and fluorescently labeled neuron populations.The SNIR has taken on management of a shared Zeiss LSM780 microscope. This instrument is approximately 4 years old. It is a high quality inverted confocal microscope with 405, 488, 514, 561, 594 and 633 nm lasers, a 32-channel spectral detector and 2 conventional PMTS. It is generally used to capacity during core working hours by investigators from approximately 10 different NIMH intramural groups.Acquisition of additional microscopes aimed at systems neuroscience and whole brain imaging is planned. These include an upright confocal/multiphoton microscope and a light sheet microscope. Renovation of space to accommodate this equipment is planned.Microbrightfield Brainmaker and Neurolucida 360 software packages have been acquired to facilitate reconstruction and analysis of systems neuroscience data.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science;Behavioral and Social Science;Bioengineering;Biomedical Imaging;Brain Disorders;Depression;Genetics;Mental Health;Mental Illness;Neurosciences;Prevention;Schizophrenia","Our brain can be considered as a type of information processing system like a computer, where input signals need to be first detected and properly represented, then integrated for decision-making and output control.  A unique feature of the brain as an information processing system lies in its adaptability.  Namely, sensory experience-induced neural activities can trigger cascades of molecular and cellular changes in brain circuits, which subsequently alter brain functions and affect behavioral outputs.  In healthy individuals, this adaptive process can adjust the brain in response to the demands of the external physical and social environments, and ultimately benefit the survival of individuals.  Abnormalities in the adaptation to environmental and social stressors can contribute to the development of a variety of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression.  In order to prevent maladaptation and develop pharmacological treatments for mental disorders, it is important to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent information processing in brain circuits.	We have chosen to use laboratory mice as a model organism to investigate the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent cortical processing.  This organism offers several major advantages for this line of study.   First, mice and humans both have about 30,000 genes, and about 99 percent of them are shared.  Second, the cellular organization of mouse cerebral cortex is similar to human, and major cortical regions are also homologous.  Third, it is possible to perform precise molecular genetic manipulations in specific types of cells in mouse brain, which is required to establish causal relationships between genes, cells, circuits and behaviors.         Our lab investigates the mechanisms by which experience-induced molecular changes impact on cortical processing of information, with a particular focus on frontal cortical circuits. Normal executive function in goal-directed behavior depends on the frontal cortex, and functional brain imaging studies have revealed altered frontal lobe activity in response to cognitive challenges in psychiatric patients. However, the mechanisms by which behavioral experiences and specific genetic factors may influence the functional cellular architecture and the developmental trajectory of frontal cortical circuits remain largely unknown.  Our recent studies have used activity-dependent gene Arc as a cellular marker to identify functional neuronal ensembles and a molecular probe to modulate circuit functions. These studies have demonstrated that the transcription of Arc is activated in selective groups of frontal cortical neurons in response to specific behavioral tasks. Arc expression regulates the persistent firing of individual neurons and predicts the consolidation of neuronal ensembles during repeated learning. Therefore, the Arc pathway represents a prototypical example of activity-dependent genetic feedback regulation of neuronal ensembles. The activation of this pathway in the frontal cortex starts during early postnatal development and requires dopaminergic (DA) input. Conversely, genetic disruption of Arc leads to a hypoactive mesofrontal dopamine circuit and its related cognitive deficit. This mutual interaction suggests an auto-regulatory mechanism to amplify the impact of neuromodulators and activity-regulated genes during postnatal development. Such a mechanism may contribute to the association of mutations in dopamine and Arc pathways with neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. As the mesofrontal dopamine circuit shows extensive activity-dependent developmental plasticity, activity-guided modulation of DA projections or Arc ensembles during development may help to repair circuit deficits related to neuropsychiatric disorders. It is generally thought that mental functions depend on coordinated activities of specific neuronal ensembles and aberrant neuronal ensemble dynamics forms the neurobiological basis of mental disorders.  A major challenge in mental health research is to identify these cellular ensembles during freely behaving state and determine what circuit mechanisms constrain their emergence and consolidation during development and learning.  In vivo optical imaging of neural activity provides important insights into brain functions at the single-cell level.  Recently, head-mounted one-photon microscopes have been developed for imaging in freely behaving animals.  However, achieving high-resolution imaging of individual neurons in the cerebral cortex while avoiding tissue damage is challenging.  To address this challenge, we have developed new approaches to specifically label subsets of neurons in the superficial or deep layers of the cortex, and improved experimental procedures to maintain the clarity of optical windows.  Our new methods allow for high-yield calcium imaging of cortical neurons with head-mounted microscopes in freely behaving animals and mapping of the spatial locations of recorded neuronal ensembles across the cortex.  In addition to improving the imaging capability of miniature microscopes in freely moving mice, this technique may be beneficial for many other optical applications such as two-photon microscopy, multi-site imaging, and optogenetic modulation.","Adaptive Behaviors;Address;Adult;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Architecture;Behavior;Behavior Control;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Brain;brain dysfunction;Brain imaging;Calcium;cell type;Cells;Cerebral cortex;Clinical;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Computers;Decision Making;Development;developmental plasticity;Dopamine;Drug Addiction;Electrophysiology (science);Engineering;Environmental Exposure;executive function;experience;Feedback;frontal lobe;Genes;Genetic;genetic manipulation;genetic risk factor;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Head;high resolution imaging;Human;Image;imaging capabilities;imaging study;improved;in vivo optical imaging;Individual;information processing;insight;interest;Label;Laboratory mice;Lead;Learning;Location;Logic;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;mental function;Mental Health;Methods;Microscope;Microscopy;Molecular;molecular dynamics;Molecular Genetics;Molecular Probes;Monitor;Mus;Mutation;neural circuit;neurobehavioral;Neurobiology;Neuromodulator;Neurons;neurophysiology;neuropsychiatric disorder;neuroregulation;novel strategies;optical imaging;Optics;optogenetics;Organism;Output;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacological Treatment;Pharmacology;Photons;Physical environment;postnatal;prevent;Procedures;Process;Regulation;relating to nervous system;repaired;Research;response;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Site;social;Social Environment;Social Interaction;stressor;Study Subject;System;Techniques;Time;Tissues;tool;translational neuroscience;two-photon;","MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF EXPERIENCE-DEPENDENT CORTICAL PROCESSING",n/a,"NIMH","9568272","","",1ZIAMH002897-11,1,ZIA,MH,002897,11,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9416747","WANG, KUAN ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1738938,
"Behavioral and Social Science;Mental Health;Neurosciences","Insect ecdysis sequences represent a simple, robust, and tractable model for studying the neuromodulatory mechanisms that govern behavior. Because initiation of an ecdysis sequence involves a profound shift in behavioral priorities, study of these sequences offers the opportunity to understand the neuromodulatory mechanisms that govern changes in behavioral state. In addition, because ecdysis behaviors are inherently sequential, they permit the systematic investigation of how motor programs are assembled and serially executed by the nervous system. Finally, the study of ecdysis sequences promises insight into how conserved circuits can be variably configured to generate immensely different behaviors. In Drosophila, for example, the motor sequences performed at pupal and adult ecdysis before and after metamorphosis, respectively are scarcely similar though they are governed by a common set of neuromodulatory/hormonal inputs. By analogy to computing, these inputs can be regarded as instructions written in a higher programming language that are then compiled into different motor output patterns. Exposing the mechanisms of neural compilation in ecdysis is likely to deeply inform our understanding of how neuromodulators contribute to neurocomputation by reconfiguring the activity of neural networks. To investigate these questions, our laboratory seeks to elucidate the circuitry that governs both the pupal and adult ecdysis sequences in Drosophila, with our primary efforts over the last year being devoted to the pupal ecdysis circuitry.  As noted above, pupal ecdysis is strictly dependent on intrinsic factors, a fact most evident from the observation that exogenous application of the peripherally released hormone, Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH) to an isolated pupal nervous system is sufficient to trigger sequential activation of neurons that express other key neuromodulators governing ecdysis. Evidence indicates that this sequential activation corresponds to the generation of a fictive ecdysis sequence, and our efforts over the last year have focused on characterizing the neuronal substrates of this fictive sequence using functional manipulations and Ca++ imaging. Following up on our previous identification of neurons directly targeted by ETH (Diao et al., 2016, Genetics 202:175-189), we are now characterizing neurons that act downstream of these targets. Of principal interest are neurons that respond to two hormones known to play important roles in generating the pupal ecdysis sequence: Bursicon and CCAP. These hormones are co-released by a small subset of ETH targets after the initiation of pupal ecdysis and have been shown to initiate the second of three phases of the pupal ecdysis sequence. We have completed an initial characterization of the neuronal populations that respond to Bursicon and CCAP, and this work is the subject of a recently submitted manuscript.  It is worth noting that this work relied heavily on two genetic targeting methods previously developed in the laboratory: The Split Gal4 system for refined transgene targeting (Luan et al., 2006, Neuron 52, 425-436) and the Trojan exon method (Diao et al., 2015, Cell Reports 10, 1410-1421). Our success in applying these techniques to elucidating the pupal ecdysis circuit illustrates a general strategy for mapping hormonally regulated networks: Using genes encoding the receptors of behaviorally relevant hormones as entry points for refined genetic and neuronal manipulations, one can establish patterns of functional connectivity between neurons in a behavioral network. The Split Gal4 system also formed the basis of two papers published in collaboration during the past year. The first describes the Split Gal4-facillitated dissection of a neural circuit that coordinates male copulation behavior in Drosophila (Pavlou et al. eLife 2016; 5:e20713. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.20713). The second describes the development of a novel genetic tool called the Killer Zipper, which augments the targeting capabilities of the Split Gal4 system (Dolan et al., Genetics 206, 775-784). The Killer Zipper is a suppressor of Split Gal4 activity that permits further refinement of the already restricted neuronal targeting that can be achieved with the Split Gal4 system. We introduce in the paper a versatile toolkit of Killer Zipper constructs and fly lines that should generally facilitate neural circuit mapping efforts in the fly and is already helping spur our own on-going investigation of the circuitry underlying the adult ecdysis sequence.  In summary, we have made good progress during the last year in elucidating the functional architecture of the neural network that underlies execution of the pupal ecdysis sequence. At the same time, we have continued to develop tools that will support not only our own circuit mapping efforts, but also those of other members of the Drosophila research community. As we use these tools to extend and refine our analysis of the circuitry underlying ecdysis sequences at all developmental stages in the fly, our work should provide insight into the principles that govern the development and function of behavioral circuits in all organisms, including humans.","Achievement;Adult;Animals;Architecture;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Metamorphosis;Biological Neural Networks;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;bursicon;Cells;Collaborations;Communities;Copulation;Cues;Derivation procedure;Development;Dissection;Drosophila genus;Drosophila melanogaster;Environment;Exons;exoskeleton;Face;fictional works;fly;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Growth;Hormonal;hormone regulation;Hormones;Human;Image;imaging study;Insecta;insight;Instruction;interest;Intrinsic factor;Investigation;Laboratories;Laboratory Research;male;Manuscripts;member;Mental disorders;Mental Health;Methods;Molting;Motor;Motor output;Nervous system structure;neural circuit;neuromechanism;Neuromodulator;Neurons;Neurophysiology - biologic function;neuroregulation;novel;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;operation;Organism;Paper;Pattern;Peripheral;Phase;Play;Population;Process;Programming Languages;programs;Publishing;Pupa;receptor;relating to nervous system;Reporting;reproductive;Research;Role;Schizophrenia;Signal Transduction;Study models;success;System;Techniques;Time;tool;Transgenes;Twin Multiple Birth;Wing;Work;","IDENTIFYING NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF BEHAVIOR IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER",n/a,"NIMH","9568257","","",1ZIAMH002800-15,1,ZIA,MH,002800,15,,Unavailable,"","","",,"7869045","WHITE, BENJAMIN H",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,1523347,

In addition, this system may be a feasible target for developing treatments that have rapid and robust efficacy in individuals who have treatment-resistant depression and suicidal thoughts. We found that the glutamatergic modulator ketamine resulted in rapid, robust and relatively sustained antidepressant, antisuicidal, and anti-anhedonic effects. Response with ketamine occurred within 2 hours and lasted approximately 1 week. Comparable response rates with standard of care treatments occur at 6-8 weeks instead of hours. Study: (Biomarkers of rapid response in major depressive disorder): protocols 04-M-0222 (NCT00088699) and 17-M-0060 (NCT03065335).OBJECTIVE: To determine the neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to the NMDA antagonist ketamine in subjects with major depressive disorder. We found robust and rapid antidepressant effects resulted from a single intravenous dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist (ketamine); onset occurred within 2 hours post-infusion and continued to remain significant for 1 week. Aims are 1) to examine the antisuicidal effects of ketamine, and 2) to examine correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder and include these data/outcome measures: clinical (e.g., family history), imaging (magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy), electrophysiological (magnetoencephalography MEG, electroencephalography EEG), neuropsychological, and biochemical (e.g., genetics, microRNA, BDNF, metabolomics), 3) To demonstrate more robust neuropharmacodynamic effects measured by neuropharmacodynamic imaging (fMRI+EEG and MEG) of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg as compared to placebo administered over 40 minutes. Secondary Outcome Measures: To determine if increases in synaptic plasticity, using electrophysiological measures in response to TMS and in association with sleep (i.e. slow wave sleep EEG activity) are associated with better antidepressant response to 0.5 mg/kg Time Frame: baseline and post-drug To demonstrate enhanced efficacy, as measured by the MADRS, of IV ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in participants with MDD using a psychophysiological technique (i.e. NPU-threat test). Time Frame: baseline and post-drug To identify baseline peripheral measures associated with response to the administration of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, as potential biomarkers of acute (24 hour) treatment response. Time Frame: baseline and post-drug Results in the past year:1. Ketamine, a rapid acting antidepressant, has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects. Ketamines mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to one day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In controls, increased gamma power was associated with increased depressive symptoms. In MDD subjects, baseline gamma power moderated the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamines mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone. 2. Motor-Activity Markers of Circadian Timekeeping Are Related to Ketamine's Rapid Antidepressant Properties. The rapid clinical antidepressant effects of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine may be due to its ability to restore synaptic plasticity and related effects on sleep-wake and circadian systems. Preclinical studies indicate that ketamine alters expression of circadian clock-associated molecules, and clinical studies of ketamine on plasticity-related biomarkers further suggest an association with sleep slow waves and sleep homeostasis. Wrist-activity monitors were used to examine the pharmacologic and rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine on markers of circadian timekeeping (amplitude and timing) in mood disorders. The findings are the first to demonstrate an association between ketamine's clinical antidepressant effects and circadian timekeeping. The results suggest that trait like circadian activity patterns indicate rapid mood response to ketamine, and that mediators of continuing ketamine-induced mood changes include altered timing and amplitude of the circadian system.3. A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Pilot Study of Riluzole Monotherapy for Acute Bipolar Depression. Glutamatergic system abnormalities are implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of both major depressive disorder and bipolar depression (BDep). Subsequent to studies demonstrating the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, other glutamatergic modulators are now being studied in clinical trials of mood disorders. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of riluzole monotherapy for the treatment of BDep. Subjects aged 18 to 70 years with bipolar disorder currently experiencing a depressive episode were tapered off of excluded medications and randomized to receive riluzole (50-200 mg/d) or placebo for 8 weeks. No significant differences in depressive symptoms were observed between subjects treated with riluzole and those receiving placebo (P = 0.12). 4. Preliminary differences in resting state MEG functional connectivity pre- and post-ketamine in major depressive disorder. Functional neuroimaging techniques including magnetoencephalography (MEG) have demonstrated that the brain is organized into networks displaying correlated activity. Group connectivity differences between healthy controls and participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) can be detected using temporal independent components analysis (ICA) on beta-bandpass filtered Hilbert envelope MEG data. We obtained MEG recordings before and after open-label infusion of 0.5mg/kg ketamine in MDD subjects and examined networks previously shown to differ between healthy individuals and those with MDD. Connectivity between the amygdala and an insulo-temporal component decreased post-ketamine in MDD subjects towards that observed in control subjects at baseline. Ketamine appeared to reduce connectivity, regardless of whether connectivity was abnormally high or low compared to controls at baseline.","Accelerometer;activity marker;Acute;aged;Amygdaloid structure;antidepressant effect;Antidepressive Agents;base;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological;Biological Markers;Bipolar Depression;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale;Cessation of life;Chronic;circadian pacemaker;Circadian Rhythms;Clinical;clinical imaging;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;collected works;Data;Depressed mood;depressive symptoms;Dose;Double-Blind Method;double-blind placebo controlled trial;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Equilibrium;Exhibits;experience;Family;Fatigue;Feeling suicidal;Functional disorder;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Genetic;Glutamates;Homeostasis;Hour;Image;imaging genetics;Impairment;impression;independent component analysis;Individual;Infusion procedures;interest;Intravenous;Ketamine;Life;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetoencephalography;Major Depressive Disorder;Manic;Measures;Mediator of activation protein;Medical;Mental Depression;metabolomics;MicroRNAs;Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale;Mood Disorders;Moods;Motor Activity;Multimodal Imaging;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;N-Methylaspartate;Nature;neural correlate;neuroimaging;Neuropsychology;NMDA receptor antagonist;open label;Outcome Measure;Participant;Patients;Pattern;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Pilot Projects;Placebo Control;Placebos;pleasure;potential biomarker;preclinical study;premature;primary outcome;Property;Protocols documentation;Proxy;Psychophysiology;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Relapse;relating to nervous system;Reporting;Research;Resistance;response;Rest;Riluzole;secondary outcome;Sleep;Slow-Wave Sleep;spectroscopic imaging;standard of care;Synaptic plasticity;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;trait;treatment response;treatment-resistant depression;Unipolar Depression;Wrist;","GLUTAMATERGIC MODULATORS FOR RAPID AND SUSTAINED ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECT",n/a,"NIMH","9589755","","",1ZIAMH002857-13,1,ZIA,MH,002857,13,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9694517","ZARATE, CARLOS ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,3741574,

Basic studies exploring the importance of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) cascade in major depressive disorder (MDD) have noted that the cAMP cascade is downregulated in MDD and upregulated by antidepressant treatment. We investigated cAMP cascade activity by using 11C-(R)-rolipram to image phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) in unmedicated MDD patients and after 8 weeks of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). We found in unmedicated MDD patients widespread, 20% reductions in 11C-(R)-rolipram binding compared with controls. SSRI treatment significantly increased rolipram binding, with significantly greater increases observed in older patients. Consistent with the results of basic studies, PDE4 was decreased in unmedicated MDD patients and increased after SSRI treatment. These results suggest that PDE4 inhibitors, which increase cAMP cascade activity, may have antidepressant effect. 2. Acute ketamine administration corrects abnormal inflammatory bone markers in major depressive disorder.Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have clinically relevant, significant decreases in bone mineral density (BMD). We sought to determine if predictive markers of bone inflammation-the osteoprotegerin (OPG)-RANK-RANKL system or osteopontin (OPN)-play a role in the bone abnormalities associated with MDD and, if so, whether ketamine treatment corrected the abnormalities. Patients with MDD had significant decreases in baseline OPG/RANKL ratio and in plasma OPN levels. Ketamine significantly increased both the OPG/RANKL ratio and plasma OPN levels, and significantly decreased RANKL levels. We conclude that the OPG-RANK-RANKL system and the OPN system play important roles in the serious bone abnormalities associated with MDD. These data suggest that, in addition to its antidepressant effects, ketamine also has a salutary effect on a major medical complication of depressive illness3. Cortical abnormalities in bipolar disorder: an MRI analysis of 6503 individuals from the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group. Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) is still not well understood. Structural brain differences have been associated with BD, but results from neuroimaging studies have been inconsistent. To address this, we performed the largest study to date of cortical gray matter thickness and surface area measures from brain magnetic resonance imaging scans of 6503 individuals including 1837 unrelated adults with BD and 2582 unrelated healthy controls for group differences while also examining the effects of commonly prescribed medications, age of illness onset, history of psychosis, mood state, age and sex differences on cortical regions. In BD, cortical gray matter was thinner in frontal, temporal and parietal regions of both brain hemispheres. BD had the strongest effects on left pars opercularis and left rostral middle frontal cortex. Our analysis revealed previously undetected associations and provides an extensive analysis of potential confounding variables in neuroimaging studies of BD.4. Increased Brain Lactate During Depressive Episodes and Reversal Effects by Lithium Monotherapy in Drug-Naive Bipolar Disorder: A 3-T 1H-MRS Study. Mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism impairment are key components in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD) and may involve a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. Measurement of brain lactate in vivo using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS) represents an important tool to evaluate mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction during mood episodes, as well as to monitor treatment response. Subjects with BD depression showed a significantly higher cingulate cortex (CC) lactate in comparison to control subjects. Furthermore, a significant decrease in CC lactate was observed after 6 weeks of lithium treatment compared with baseline. CC Lactate levels was associated with family history of mood disorders and plasma lithium levels. These findings indicate a shift to anaerobic metabolism and a role for lactate as a state marker during mood episodes. 5. Active suicidal ideation during clinical antidepressant trials. Suicidal patients are often excluded from clinical trials of psychiatric medications and from investigations using neurobiological techniques. To evaluate the presence, impact, and stability of active suicidal ideation (SI) across a range of antidepressant trials, we reviewed clinical trials conducted in patients with either major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). Across clinical trials, participants (23%) reported active SI at some point during study participation. The results suggest that research can be conducted in depressed patients with active SI if such research coincides with careful observation. Active SI and pessimism may be particularly vulnerable to fluctuation.6. Anhedonia as a clinical correlate of suicidal thoughts in clinical ketamine trials.  Anhedonia occurs across psychiatric diagnoses and has been associated with specific neural circuits in response to rapid-acting treatments, such as ketamine. This analysis included treatment-resistant patients with depression from several clinical trials of ketamine. Anhedonia was assessed using a subscale of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). One day post-ketamine administration, improvements on the SHAPS accounted for an additional 13% of the variance in suicidal thought reduction, beyond the influence of depressive symptoms. Suicidal thoughts may be related to symptoms of anhedonia independent of other depressive symptoms. 7. Acute risk factors for suicide attempts and death: prospective findings from the STEP-BD study. Suicide is unfortunately common in psychiatric practice, but difficult to predict. The present study sought to assess which clinical symptoms increase in the months before suicidal behavior in a sample of psychiatric outpatients with bipolar disorder. Participants were assessed using for the following potential acute risk factors for suicidal behavior: suicidal ideation, loss of interest, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, and high-risk behavior. Each of the five symptoms was elevated overall in individuals who engaged in suicidal behavior. Suicidal ideation, loss of interest and, to a lesser extent, anxiety may represent acute suicide risk factors up to four months before suicidal behavior in outpatients with bipolar disorder. 8. Increased activity or energy as a primary criterion for the diagnosis of bipolar mania in DSM-5. DSM-5 describes 'a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy' as a primary criterion for mania. Using data from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder study, the authors analyzed point prevalence data obtained at the initial visit to assess the diagnostic validity of this new DSM-5 criterion. When the new DSM-5 criterion of increased activity or energy was added as a coprimary symptom, the prevalence of mania and hypomania was reduced. The findings confirm that including increased activity or energy as part of DSM-5 criterion A decreases the prevalence of manic and hypomanic episodes but does not affect longitudinal clinical outcomes.","Acute;Address;Adult;Aerobic;Age;age difference;Agitation;Alcohols;Anaerobic Bacteria;Anhedonia;antidepressant effect;Antidepressive Agents;Anxiety;Area;Beck depression inventory;Binding;Biological Markers;Bipolar Disorder;bipolar mania;bone;Bone Density;Brain;Brain imaging;Cerebral hemisphere;cingulate cortex;Clinical;Clinical Trials;clinically relevant;Closure by clamp;collected works;Conduct Clinical Trials;Confounding Factors (Epidemiology);Control Groups;Cyclic AMP;Data;Depressed mood;depressed patient;depressive symptoms;design;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diazoxide;Dimensions;Dose;Double-Blind Method;DSM-V;Electrophysiology (science);Energy Metabolism;experience;Family;Family history of;Feeling suicidal;Female;frontal lobe;Functional disorder;Genes;Genetic;Glutamate Transporter;Glutamates;Glycine;Glycine Receptors;gray matter;Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression;high risk behavior;hypomania;Image;Impairment;improved;in vivo;Individual;Inflammatory;Infusion procedures;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;Intervention;Intravenous;Investigation;Irritable Mood;Ketamine;Left;Lithium;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Major Depressive Disorder;male;Manic;Measurement;Measures;medical complication;Mental Depression;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mitochondria;mitochondrial dysfunction;Monitor;Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale;Mood Disorders;Moods;MRI Scans;National Institute of Mental Health;neural circuit;Neurobiology;neurochemistry;neuroimaging;neurophysiology;Neuropsychological Tests;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;older patient;Onset of illness;open label;Oral;Osteitis;osteopontin;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Outpatients;Parietal;Participant;Patient Self-Report;Patients;peripheral blood;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;phenomenological models;Phenotype;phosphodiesterase IV;Placebos;Plasma;Play;pleasure;potential biomarker;predictive marker;Prevalence;programs;prospective;Protocols documentation;Protons;Psychiatric Diagnosis;Psychotic Disorders;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Reporting;Research;Research Domain Criteria;Resistance;response;Risk Factors;Role;Rolipram;Sampling;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor;Sex Characteristics;Signal Transduction;Site;spectroscopic imaging;suicidal;suicidal behavior;suicidal morbidity;suicidal patient;suicidal risk;Suicide;Suicide attempt;Surface;symptomatology;Symptoms;Syndrome;System;Techniques;Therapeutic Agents;Thick;TNFSF11 gene;tool;treatment effect;treatment response;Tumor necrosis factor receptor 11b;Validation;Visit;working group;","NEUROBIOLOGY AND TARGET VALIDATION OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AGENTS IN MOOD DISORDERS",n/a,"NIMH","9589759","","",1ZIAMH002927-08,1,ZIA,MH,002927,08,,Unavailable,"","","",,"9694517","ZARATE, CARLOS ",Not Applicable,n/a,"Unavailable","","","","","","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH","","","Unavailable","","", ,"","","",Intramural Research,2017,NIMH,,,2014694,
